and  uh    can we take a water break  yes   okay  yeah  we just sort of rushed it a little   we didn t get exactly what we wanted i wanted a church wedding   i wanted the dress and my bridesmaids  and the   i know  and the hair   i wanted the first dance to be a tango   i wanted it to be baby  i love your way   because that s the best song ever but   oh  anyway  we didn t get any of that   what we got was a cranky judge at city hall    oh  126 years of wedded bliss   we did get that and three lovely kids   oh  so  when is the big day   the day we picked actually has a lot of significance   the hour and the minute we picked has significance  too   because it was the minute that we both knew simultaneously   without telling each other that we were getting married   we checked the time  8 22 p m   there s actually this joke that i told that really sealed the deal   elizabeth   laughing it s so funny   laughing  my favorite joke no one had ever laughed at it that hard    i suppose i have to hear it  no  i promise  it d kill you   babe  don t oversell it i mean  it s pretty good  but    you can t oversell it  yeah  well  i need a visual aid     phone ringing  oh  no  oh  crud  it s jay   don t  don t tell her without me hold on   hey  jay  what s up   sorry to bother you  ma am i know you re in that lesson   yeah  no  that s fine what do you got   uh  an earful from the mexican deputy foreign minister   they re wavering on the border security deal   why  i just talked to president zaragoza this morning   and this afternoon  arizona governor barker implemented a new policy   of separating children from parents   who illegally cross the border into the state   wait  they re separating children from their parents   i know  it s crazy   okay  aside from all the obvious questions of humanity   decency and shame how can they even do that   without blatantly encroaching on federal immigration law   they probably can t but arizona recently passed a law   authorizing state police to temporarily detain anyone   who fails to provide documentation of lawful presence in the country   until now  that s meant a few hours before turning  em over to the feds    and now  governor s office is claiming weeks   months in some cases   i m gonna kill governor barker   i mean  talk to him first  at least   white house has already set up a call and invited state to join in half an hour   okay  good   if you wanna finish the lesson i could handle it   no  no  no  i  no   i m on my way in just a few minutes you go enjoy your evening    thank you  ma am  bye   jay man  you here for the nine o clock game  too   win  hey    uh  yeah  maybe  man  this is such a coincidence   i literally just got out of a meeting with rob phelps   who said i should get a sit down with your boss or you    we re pretty busy  saving the world  love it   and  hey  you could save it a lot faster if the government legalizes marijuana     laughs  okay  we ll keep that in mind  love it  hey   i could swing by your office tomorrow we can grab lunch   dalton  are you really separating children from their parents   man  it s called enforcing the law  you ought to try it sometime  mr  president   oh  you can count on the attorney general and me enforcing the law   your law isn t arizona law   it is  when you encroach on federal immigration policy   my ag tells me i m on firm legal ground   elizabeth  governor forget the legal argument   your new policy  besides being inhumane   is already jeopardizing our border security deal with mexico   a deal that your state    stands to gain from  says who   i say it will endanger the good people of arizona   after that shameful immigration debacle   you people jammed through congress last summer   you forced my hand here   governor  if you re trying to kill the border deal   i am trying to deter future illegals   if it spoils your little deal all the better   okay  i m sorry  you re taking children from their parents as a deterrent   someone had to grow a pair  ma am   do i really have to explain to you how barbaric and un american that is   if you re gonna make deals with mexico you gotta be tough   now  i ll consider backing off the separation policy   if you get lower immigration caps higher thresholds for asylum seekers   and mexican support for construction of a border wall   you don t get to call the shots here governor   you don t get to call the shots here in arizona  we re done    son of a bitch hung up on me  trying to leverage us   sighs  how do we leverage back hell  how do we level him   sir  the underlying arizona statute was carefully drafted   to sit right on the line of what arizona can get away with   without getting preempted by federal law   so  where does that leave us   there is a strong argument that the statute is unconstitutional as applied   doj is putting together a challenge of the policy   as a violation of the supremacy clause   good  i would think the constitution would be on our side here   we ll also argue that the policy is a violation of the due process   and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment   what s the bottom line  hank   well  like russell said the law s on our side   but these court challenges will take time   unless we try for a preliminary injunction to halt the policy   any down side to that   sighs  we lose  publicly   i can live with that  i can t live with letting this go unchecked   i ll get into it   sighs   i want other options  we need to attack this on as many fronts as possible   well  what about a legislative solution   we choke off federal funding to arizona   until the families are back together and this policy is revoked    bring governor barker to heel  i like the sound of that too   but how do we get the votes   uh  i can talk to senator morejon   anti immigration champion   leader of the squash elizabeth mccord club  morejon   the man s a senior senator from arizona   you really think he d go against his own state s governor   we ve worked together before land mines a while back   i ve seen his softer side   and if you get morejon  you think he can deliver his anti immigration caucus   he is the senior senator from arizona it gives him standing   every second this policy remains in place is an affront to basic human dignity   and a national disgrace   go get him  bess   i got ball   here you sure you didn t play college   come on  d 3  right   indistinct shouting   agh    you all right  no  i m not all right  just back off    here  help him up  thank you  thank you     groans  i m so sorry  man  that was my fault   it was good d  no one s fault just  i m sorry i snapped    thank you  thanks  thank you  yeah  all right    here  here  let me  no  no  i got it  i got it   you know what you need for that   a little cbd thc gel cap i got some in my bag    no  win  uh uh  seriously  dude   cannabis meds are state of the art for pain management   well  okay i ll take that under consideration   i m gonna hold you to that and listen  while i have you   did you ever consider that legalization of marijuana   is the best way for the us to weaken the mexican cartels   and stem the flow of drugs across the border   did you just trip me on purpose so you could lobby me   dude  of course not i m on your team    not tonight  but i got your back  ugh  my   it s just  i know m sec is looking to make a border security deal with mexico   and legalization is the pathway to security    if you want  i can introduce you  no  don t want  stop lobbying me   my bad  all right   i ll call you tomorrow i ll send you a white paper on cannabis    win  go away  all right  cool  yeah   say hi to daisy  who s got next   mr  bramble i ve reviewed your application    for a preliminary injunction  thank you  your honor   arizona s policy of forcibly separating parents and children   yes  yes  you re arguing the supremacy clause   but an injunction is extraordinary relief   but we believe our likelihood of success on the merits   i d like to hear from the attorney general of arizona   the likelihood is slim  your honor   the arizona policy at issue was narrowly crafted to comport with federal law   it flies in the face of federal law your honor   reasonable minds can disagree  i think we need a full adjudication here   the bigger issue is the irreparable harm posed to the minors   who are subjected to this draconian decree   hysterics  judge   it s a temporary displacement of children from their parents   the duration of the separation is not the issue  the fact of it is   children are legally separated from their parents all the time   when the parents are imprisoned when they are placed in foster care   after an adjudication and due process  yes   i m curious to see you here mr  jackson   this is a pressing matter for the administration   pressing enough for a presidential emissary to appear at counsel s table    i am a licensed attorney  judge  and the president s chief of staff   don t think i don t recognize intimidation when i see it   well   it s a shameful abuse of executive power   judge  the stakes of arizona s decision to flout federal policy   can be decided at trial   the government s motion for a preliminary injunction is denied   thank you  your honor   judge  there are six more arguments in our brief   none of which merited consideration   i think  given the enormity of the issue   mr  bramble  you are counsel of record not mr  jackson   so  either muzzle him or he can consider his impertinence   during his night in lock up   bangs gavel    dismissed  all rise    thank you  you got it   this is highly irregular  mr  jackson   i don t countenance ex parte communications   it s not ex parte  your honor i m not here to talk substance   i m busy  mr  jackson   too busy to be fair minded   excuse me   look  you know the stakes of this case   for the children  for us policy for the country   none of that concerns me only the law does   the law  which you short circuited by ignoring six of our arguments   i d like to know why   i was short listed by the last administration   for an appellate seat years ago   you know why i still haven t gotten it   because the obstructive dalton administration   found me not to its ideological liking   your president  elizabeth mccord   your whole cohort is contemptuous of american values   but you don t represent the majority   you represent a soon to be disempowered minority  clinging to power   and bent on flushing this country down the sewer   but the only thing that s going to be flushed on my watch is you   now  get out   let me look into mr  whitman s schedule and i ll get back to you    of course  mr  barrington  was that win barrington   yes he s been trying to get in to see jay   no  he s trying to circumvent jay s assistant  he thinks you re a loophole   blake  tell nina someone s trying to loophole her   i m sorry   he s a representative of a wellness advocacy group   wellness advocacy  it s win barrington trying to lobby jay to legalize pot    ah  yes  see  part of your job   is to sandbag dudes like this who think they can work around the gatekeepers   and waste everybody s time with vaporizers and bongs   the dude s a clown blake will fill you in   blake sighs   okay  win was daisy s fianc   she broke up with him to start dating matt   actually  they were already secretly dating    oh  yeah   i m reading you in on classified information  so   so  on election night  a few years ago matt was making a play for daisy   but she went home with win instead so  what you are looking at now is   two alphas  neither of whom ended up with the girl  got it    so  go ahead and make the appointment  god  no  win s a ridiculous pot lobbyist   i just thought you d be interested in the gossip   oh   hm   you re actually suggesting that i sponsor a bill   to cut off all federal funding to my home state   i m suggesting you help reunite children   with their moms and dads as quickly as possible   the way to do that is through the courts   well  unfortunately   the administration s application for a preliminary injunction was denied   so  any legal remedy could take months   if we want to end this quickly congress needs to step up   i don t like barker s methods   but i don t disagree with his position on border security   i m not asking you to take sides on that deal   yes  you are   and arizonans are deeply concerned about unchecked immigration   carlos  i know your thoughts on the border   i m just asking you to help these kids    by committing political suicide  by doing the right thing   i know what s right  and i am staunchly against the federal government   undermining a state s authority to regulate its own border   senator  you know there are a million reasons   the federal government has to be in charge of the border    you want to talk state s rights  elizabeth  how about human rights   i understand that we disagree on policy   but this is about who we are as a country   and anyone who doesn t fight this appalling human rights violation   with everything they ve got even if it means political suicide   may as well be for it   it is a moral outrage   and you may be right   sighs   but i will not let the federal government bully my home state    i m sorry  look  i hope you heal fast  thanks   and from what i hear  these detention centers aren t all that bad   they say it s like summer camp for kids   thanks for stopping by  senator   door closes    you all right  sorry i snapped   my ankle   man  this is hard  i haven t written a poem since  like  seventh grade    actually  it was more of a rap  ooh  a rap could be fun   yeah  hmm  but no  no   hey  guys  i think i got something   the way we love our perfect parents can never be co opted   though stevie was an accident and ali is adopted    cut it out  please  be serious   no  you know what it s a little hard to be serious   with everything going on in arizona   can t you just donate money to the aclu like i did    and get on board with the celebration   phone chimes   okay  this is the only part that i actually asked you to help with    no  what   laser dawn is cancelling    what is that  why   the band i booked for the afterparty   they re breaking up over creative differences   they re a wedding band  what creative differences could they have   the name  for starters   well  why did we even get a band they re so cheesy    we should just get a dj  what  no  mom and dad are cheesy   and they wanted a band   and this is their party and we re supposed to be helping   how am i supposed to book a decent band   mock sobbing in the middle of the holidays at the last minute    you were going for decent  no  jason  i was going for good   but now i m at decent  and tomorrow   i might be at washboard and mouth harp for all i know   it was always a long shot with morejon   i don t know i thought i got through to him   never underestimate a senator s desire to keep their seat   i actually think i overestimated our checks and balances   against malfeasance and bad faith   yeah  our system counts on our public officials to be of good faith   we rely on their basic decency and morality   without it  norms break down   even the president of the united states can end up powerless to fix things   oh  i m not giving up on you yet  sir   thanks  but the good people of arizona   have been sold a bill of goods by a demagogue   spouting about a fake trumped up crisis at the border   and now children are paying the price    hey  sorry  i m late   i had a few things to finish up   well  we seem to be out of checks and balances  so no worries   yeah  uh  about that   pouring   after getting shot down by judge mayfield   my spidey sense told me something was amiss   so  i stopped by his chambers   ooh  judges love it when you do that   actually  i was counting on getting his dander up and he didn t disappoint   revealed his true partisan hack colors    fishing for grounds to appeal  yeah  i already hooked one   i spent the afternoon poking around   found the judge has real estate holdings in arizona   that are directly affected by state policies   dictated by our friend governor barker   well  that s a hell of a coincidence   not when you consider they were fraternity brothers at arizona state   you think that s a clear enough conflict of interest   oh  yeah ag s reviewing it with his team   i d love to blow that little weasel right off the bench   i m just concerned about the optics of the white house going after a judge   because we don t like his ruling   i m not sure if this particular bullet should stay in the chamber  so to speak   aren t we beyond worrying about optics our standing in the world is at stake   i say fire that bullet   senator    how s the leg   groans   in spanish   morejon chuckles   in spanish    excuse me  can i get a cranberry soda  all right   in spanish   i assume you re asking this because i m cuban   brown   to them  you re brown first generation  but   in spanish   oh  i know your family s story it s on your website   they were boat people  crammed into an overloaded trawler escaping castro   they were lucky to get to shore because of the wet foot  dry foot policy   how were your parents any different from the parents in arizona   who are separated from their kids tonight   well  my mother and my father didn t break the law   look  my dad s from uruguay but  i m a stealth latino   i know it   every once in a while when i m out somewhere   talking to my dad on the phone or speaking spanish for whatever reason   i notice some people look at me differently  instant lower status   every once in a while they tell me to   speak english  amigo   or  american  that s my favorite   well  sometimes people hand me their keys at the valet   yale  harvard law  rhodes scholar us senator  all they see is brown guy   that s right  some people   in spanish   but jay  i don t need you to lecture me on unconscious bias   unconscious is that what you think it is   how can you ignore the blatant racism of this policy   don t we already have a steep enough hill to climb   without allowing arizona to normalize treating people like us   as less than human   if not for those kids in detention how about for our kids    how is this not more personal for you  secretary put you up to this   por favor  she doesn t know anything i saw you wavering in her office   i know you wanna be on the right side of this   look  there are no sides  jay   the only way to change what people see is to continue to succeed   not through identity politics   but hard work   i never sought to be the moses for latinos   my kids see how hard i work and what i ve achieved   just like your daughter sees you   and for me  that  that is enough   and  uh  i m sorry that it s not the same for you   this case has been remanded by the appellate court for reconsideration   on the grounds that judge mayfield was conflicted   the issue before us is whether to grant a preliminary injunction   halting arizona s detention of unauthorized immigrants    counsel  judge pollard    if i can direct the court to us v  jenlow  not apposite  your honor   i disagree  and i ve reviewed the petitioner s affidavits in detail   the government has clearly made a prima facie showing   of irreparable harm to these children    your honor  i also believe   that petitioner s likelihood of success on the merits is great    judge  the apa s amicus brief  i ve read it  miss cutler   and unless you have anything new   i m inclined to rule against the state of arizona   and grant a preliminary   in a case brought on behalf of the separated families by the aclu   the 9th circuit has just affirmed the district court of arizona s opinion   that the affected families of arizona s separation order   do not suffer irreparable harm   judge  the aclu is a private litigant    so the case is not precisely on point  that is true   and this court is not bound by another federal appellate court s judgment   also true  but the opinion adjudicated nearly identical facts   i consider that persuasive authority   and a judgment i am not inclined to contravene   uh  wait  so  that s it   an inadvertent legal wire crossing   means all those kids have to remain separated from their parents   i m afraid so   you ll have to let your suit wend its way through the system  mr  jackson    look at this  a sign from the gods  hey   i m trolling for favors and here you are   i also need to hit up russell jackson as well   this might not be the best time   yeah  i heard  bit of an ouchy in court how else would you describe it   oh  i don t know  mike maybe sensitively    hm  what favors are you here for   i need recommendation letters for my kid s super elitist   beyond his intellectual capacity private school   mike  do you really want   to send your son to a school that he is not suited for   100 percent so  can i count on you   well  it s a hell of a day to be asking for a favor for your privileged kid   sighs  all right send me his application and his s    no promises  fine   i also got the invite to your vow thing   nice optics  i can t believe i didn t think of it myself    i reached out to the videographer  no publicity   no publicity  just a videographer  very discreet drones  you won t hear them   mike  this is a personal and private event  no politics  no angles   look  i have been dissecting the polls and while you have broad support   no pun intended you lack voter intensity   people like you but they don t love you you know what could change that   the sight of you in a wedding dress america would go macadamia    as in nuts  i put it together    well  the answer s still no   let s just get the footage and then we ll sort it out in post   president zaragoza i agree this is a travesty   arizona won t even let mexican diplomats in to visit our citizens   that s unacceptable and we will do everything in our power   to help your people gain access as soon as possible   i m afraid  until this outrage is ended   it is not just our border security deal that is off the table   our entire relationship is at stake    mario  i am sorry   he s right i d have reacted the same way   so  our border security deal is dead   our vital trade agreements   and a million others with our neighbors to the south are threatened   and every hour that passes with kids separated from their parents   lowers our standing in the world   courts can t help us  congress won t   and we are powerless to do a damn thing about it   did i miss anything   henry  maybe one   lao tzu said   an ant on the move does more than a dozing ox   what the hell does that mean   if you can t do everything at least do something    keep moving in the right direction  what do you have in mind  henry   go down there  mr  president   walk those mexican officials into the detention center yourself   russell  whoa  whoa  whoa   that could open us up to accusations of infringing on states  rights   that is practically asking for a constitutional crisis   look  i am as disgusted as any of you   but i will throw my body in front of that   well  then  i ll do it    did you hear what i just said  yes  and i m not the president   you might be ensuring that you never will be   it s domestic interference   i d be the secretary of state working with our mexican allies   to visit their own citizens   henry  advocating for foreign dignitaries on our soil   it s not only a moral imperative it s a diplomatic one as well   sounds very  secretary of statey  to me   mr  president  governor barker s intentionally provocative policy   deserves to be met with an equally provocative response   chanting   well  it s not exactly the hilton   it d be different if their parents were with them   oh  god    this isn t gonna be easy  nope  it s not  ma am   but you know what  there s no other place i would rather be   the second we re done here  feel free to go see your dad  how far away is he   a couple hours  in aguila  thank you but i ll probably take a rain check    madam secretary  ambassador lopez   you know kat sandoval    mucho gusto  igualmente   i am here at the direction of president zaragoza   to look after the interests of my citizens   of course    well  woman  secretary mccord    let s do this  all right   good afternoon  officer keegan   i m elizabeth mccord  this is mexican ambassador rafael lopez    well  how are you today  i m okay  ma am  but i m afraid   that s great  i m here to escort the ambassador inside the facility   so that he can check on his citizens   i m afraid i m not authorized to allow that  ma am   i wasn t clear about that either  and   this is kat sandoval  my policy advisor kat  can you help us out here   hey there  officer keegan it s totally understandable   that you wouldn t be up to speed  given the different state and federal laws   it can be a little bit  you know uh  confusing   however under title 22 usc section 2651   foreign nationals on us soil  you must yield and allow entry immediately   huh   yeah and it literally says  immediately    hey  miller  i don t think we wanna get    any of our bosses involved  no   right  officer keegan   um  you ll just need to surrender your phones    great  thank you  of course     knock on door  win  hey    hey  here s a blast from your past   what are you doing here   okay  maybe not my strongest entrance but i do come bearing gifts   i realize i m a little late with the baby present    what is he  five months now  she    and a year  oh   wow  uh  well  then i guess it s a birthday present   and here s a little something i brought for jay   i feel so bad about what happened   i m not sure he believed i didn t do it on purpose   but i swear  i m not a good enough defensive player to make that happen   yeah  i m not entirely in the loop on this and i like it that way   fair enough   it s just that earlier   i was asking about the possibility of a sit down with the secretary   look  it s kind of a busy day around here   you re going to have to find someone else to lobby   well  can you just make sure he gets this then   it  uh  has some goodies in there that will help with the pain   did you seriously bring a controlled substance into the state department   not for the first time  if you recall   you know  when there was a lockdown   and i got matt high and i found out that you were cheating on me with him   okay  i will  i will get this to jay   and i will tell him whatever it is i remember of what you just said   you re a peach but  you know  like a really smart one    hm  i m sorry   maybe i shouldn t have gone with a stone fruit  it   all right  yeah   in here    oh  my god   children crying   in spanish it s night  i want my mom   how is this possible   the great united states of america   children crying softly   hey  excuse me   are you going to change that boy s diaper   i mean  i m assuming he has one   child aides make rounds every three hours   three hours   so  you re just gonna leave him like that   cause  where are his clothes i ll change him myself    ma am  that s not procedure  i don t care about procedure   look at him   hola   in spanish    daniel  daniel   in spanish   security buzzer   secretary elizabeth mccord  you are trespassing on arizona state property    am i really  you tricked your way in here   grandstanding for the press on your self promotion tour   but you re a long way from the federal swamp you call home   well  governor if washington dc is a swamp   what s this   it s none of your business is what it is   and there s a sheriff out front with a warrant for your arrest   is he going to arrest ambassador lopez as well   mr  ambassador   i m sorry you got dragged into madam secretary s little publicity stunt   i didn t get dragged into anything   my government demands these innocent children   get reunited with their parents immediately   your government has no authority here  sir   scoffs  neither does yours  ma am   i think the ambassador s demand is on humanitarian grounds   i don t care if it s on grounds of coffee  this is my state and my rules   lucky for you i m feeling charitable today   y all can exit peaceably through the back without talking to any press   and i ll let you leave the state without incident   ha  without incident  okay   look around  governor  we re past that   i suggest you get moving   before i invite the good sheriff in here to come and get ya   do you think you can intimidate me or shut me up   don t test arizona justice  ma am   man  saint francis said   all the darkness in the world cannot extinguish   the light of a single candle   if it took a visit from the secretary of state   to shine a light on the darkness inside this building   then praise the lord for sending her   and god bless and protect those children   our little brothers and sisters in the lord s kingdom   why did you come to arizona madam secretary    what did you see in there  are the children being mistreated   what do you hope to prove   i came here to see for myself   and to help ambassador lopez see what s going on behind these walls   what i saw is an affront to decency   and an assault on our country s core values   children separated from their parents   in cages  crying  terrified   lacking basic care   phone rings   the governor believes it s a deterrent    it ll keep others  hi    are you seeing this  yep   that s your mom    it is child abuse  plain and simple   siren approaching   ma am   no deterrent is worth trading our humanity    that s enough  no policy  no matter its goal   is worth lowering our moral standing in the world    governor  all right  nothing can justify harming children    ma am  you are on state property  now  the governor wants me to shut up    yes  but i won t   because what he s doing is immoral and un american   and every american needs to know about it   elizabeth mccord   you are under arrest for criminal trespass    in the first degree in violation  no    no  no  of section 13 1504   well  if desperate asylum seekers   aren t free from being detained unfairly in this state   why should i   take her in  trooper   it s okay  jared  it s okay   officer stevens   if

has arrived   and awaits the honor of your attention    show them in     ambassador   welcome to krill    thank you for receiving us  chancellor    we do not get many visitors   i can only assume you have come with good reason    that is for you to decide    i am told that moclus has been expelled from the planetary union    it was inevitable   the union imposes its values on other cultures   while refusing to confront its own hypocrisy   a governance of elitist fools    on that we agree    moclus and krill  however   have much to offer one another in these dangerous times   we have confirmed reports that the kaylon are amassing thousands of ships   the pattern of deployment suggests   they are preparing to launch a full scale invasion   teleya  i am aware of the threat   the worlds in closest proximity are vikarris and xelayah   they will likely be the first targets    and when those worlds are reduced to ashes  who will be next    you propose an alliance   what exactly do you offer    moclus was the primary manufacturer of armaments for the union   what we provided them can be provided to any ally    and what do you expect in return    the protection of your superior fleet   our two great militaries would ensure a formidable defense against the kaylon    and any other union of militaries who may oppose us    indeed    who would lead this alliance    naturally  we would    on what basis    you are a female   any other arrangement would be  offensive   scoffs    how surprising that the union revoked your membership   i must admit  however that i admire your hubris   to enter the dominion of a foreign power   and suggest the wholesale submission of its entire military industrial complex   there is a phrase i once heard uttered by a human helmsman   aboard the union ship orville   you have got balls    it is the only acceptable arrangement    i will consider your proposal for alliance under one condition   a partnership of command    i will need to consult with my government    your weapons may be superior   but as tacticians you leave much to be desired   i have studied your battle strategies   they are blunt and maladroit   you lack the cunning and intellect of the female mind   i will provide this   all command decisions will be shared equally   or there will be no alliance   do i make myself clear    yes  chancellor    i await your decision     theme song playing       intense music playing      defensive line is moving into position    nineteen kaylon ships just dropped out of quantum    ten million kilometers and closing    general quarters all hands  battle stations    bridge to engineering   what s your status    the device is drawing steady power from the quantum core    it ll be fully armed in about two minutes  sir power surging   ed mercer  isaac  prepare to initiate on my command   isaac  yes  sir     dramatic music playing      captain  another 42 ships just dropped out of quantum    jesus  they re all around us      charly  how soon  charly burke  about 30 seconds  captain   mercer signal all ships to tighten formation    aye  sir   burke device is fully armed  sir    isaac  initiate   power surging   alarm buzzing   isaac isaac to bridge  were we successful    yes  isaac   you could say that     contemplative music playing       light music playing      you two have done a great service for the union   for the first time in over a year we can all breathe a sigh of relief   isaac  the combination of my superior intellect   and ensign burke s capacity for multi dimensional visualization   was sufficient for the development of this technology    we  worked together    yes  but how did you accomplish it so quickly     for great achievements two things are needed   a plan  and not quite enough time    churchill isaac  leonard bernstein    can this device be used on a larger scale   isaac  the radius of destruction is limited   only by the amount of power available   the orville s quantum core was sufficient to destroy all kaylon vessels   within a radius of ten million kilometers    so in principle it could go even farther    yes  sir given a sufficient power source   the range would be unlimited    and none of our ships or people would be affected    no  sir   isaac and i discovered their achilles heel   by studying the kaylon the orville found on situla four   every kaylon and every one of their ships is connected   through a synchronization matrix   that s how they coordinate all their actions   even across light years of space    and that s how you got inside the kaylon network   isaac  correct the device uses quantum energy   to trigger a feedback loop in its interlink chain    basically  it turns the relays into a row of dominoes   knock one down  they all go down   isaac  after the initiation sequence is transmitted   it cannot be countermanded    and what about you why weren t your systems damaged    i am no longer connected to the synchronization matrix    this is better than we ever could ve hoped for   our priority now should be to build a quantum core   that can maximize the weapon s range   and eradicate the kaylon threat completely    yes  sir we can get to work on your order    uh  well  now wait a second with all due respect   we re being very cavalier about this  aren t we   i mean  you do realize what you re talking about is  is genocide    isaac was tasked with developing a weapon that could defeat the kaylon   he exceeded our expectations   we d be fools not to use it    and is it really genocide   if our only objective is to prevent them from killing every other living species   including us    admiral  we ve seen first hand that the kaylon   are capable of change and growth   our experience with timmis    yes  i read your report about the emotive kaylon    it proves they can evolve    it proves nothing   that kaylon didn t evolve on its own   it was modified by a cyberneticist   and correct me if i m wrong but it didn t work with isaac here   isaac  that is correct   my capacity to experience emotion was only temporary    captain mercer  if you think that we can enlist and train   an army of cyberneticists to teach empathy to ten billion kaylon   i d love to hear your plan    look  all i m saying is that we have created a weapon   of unparalleled destructive power   and i just think that before we go cracking eggshells with a sledgehammer   we  need to consider the moral implications    i agree this is an unprecedented situation with profound ethical questions   but how we proceed won t be decided in this room   it s a matter for the union council   until they make a determination there s nothing more to say     tranquil music playing      you re kidding me  right what is there to even talk about    i mean  it s just a big decision    how is it a big decision they want us all dead   we want to stay alive that s a pretty basic equation   it s us or them    yeah  i know the kaylon got a raw deal back home   but i gotta say  i agree with charly   plus the fact that we re sitting ducks since we kicked the moclans out   john lamarr look  charly  don t get me wrong   as an engineer  i am blown away by what you and isaac were able to do here   but i also understand why people are taking a minute    i agree  we re talking about exterminating an entire species   i can t think of anything that runs more contrary to union values    and let s be goddamn clear about the motive   are we doing this to save ourselves or is this revenge    my dad used to say revenge is for children and savages    yeah  well  he never had his leg cut off    oh  come on  man  it s a joke    it s not funny  sorry    look  i know isaac s your best pal so maybe you re a little biased    hey  watch it  ensign   i gotta get back to duty    if we d had this weapon a year ago and used it   amanda might still be alive   we built it  we tested it  it works   let s wipe  em off the face of the galaxy     contemplative music playing      that was the most heated session i ve ever witnessed   but the union council has reached a compromise   they ve decided we should use the weapon   as a deterrent    meaning what exactly    according to napoleon the whole of war   is to frighten your enemy into submission ideally without fighting   he was a tyrant but he was accurate on that point   we will travel to kaylon to reveal the nature of the device   and our willingness to use it   they saw what happened to their invasion force at xelayah   if nothing else the kaylon are logical beings   it should persuade them to accept an immediate and absolute cease fire    and if they refuse our terms    we re authorized to use the weapon again to make our point clear     martial music playing      captain  we re approaching the kaylon system    go to tactical alert    five kaylon vessels on an intercept course    bridge to engineering everything ready    we re at full power   mercer stand by

speak with kaylon primary    they are powering weapons    we re armed with the weapon we deployed during our last confrontation   stand down or we will be forced to use it again      engineering

we will receive you   transmitting landing coordinates    got  em    stand down tactical alert   take us down       uneasy music playing       epic music playing      kaylon primary   kaylon primary that is correct    you look better than the last time we saw you   kaylon primary a kaylon s neural matrix   can be regenerated indefinitely   an advantage biologicals do not have   state your demands    our demands are simple   end your campaign to exterminate us   stop your attacks against our ships and our worlds   recall your vessels and cease all further weapons construction   we will place monitoring stations inside your territory to verify your compliance   kaylon primary do you intend to enslave us    of course not we re not here to conquer you   we just want to end the violence   and establish a basis for peaceful coexistence   kaylon primary  how do we know this is not a deception    we could ve killed every one of you without warning   we didn t   kaylon primary  why    because we re not the monsters you think we are    we believe the quality of mercy is mightiest in the mightiest   regardless  deception or not you don t have a choice   trust us  or be destroyed   it s a simple binary decision   kaylon primary  we have no defense against your weapon   therefore  we will surrender to your demands    it may not seem like it now   but one day you ll realize that you ve made the right decision   kaylon primary  we will find a weakness in your weapon    trust me it s a bad idea for you to go looking   isaac  any attempt to disable the weapon will immediately activate it   kaylon primary there is always a weakness  isaac   your existence is proof of that    i ll inform the union council that you ve agreed to our terms   we ll work out the details of the armistice in the coming weeks   i imagine we ll be seeing each other again soon   kaylon primary  indeed     peaceful guitar music playing        through the corridors of sleep     past shadows dark and deep

this may be the single greatest step   toward the cause of galactic peace in our lifetimes   and you should all feel insanely proud of yourselves   even gordon   laughter  thank you  thanks a lot    so  this is a rare bottle of very old rum from the 21st century   my dad told me it was only to be opened   for the most special of occasions   and if he were still with us today i think he d give this one the thumbs up   so  here s to you  dad and let s get hammered    yeah  cheers     jazzy guitar music playing      kel  this place is so beautiful god  i d wanna spend all my time here   forget space    yeah  my dad left it in good condition   ed and i used to come here during the holidays when we were married   it s been a while   i miss it    yeah  i bet    i told you  you are doing it wrong    i am doing it exactly as i was shown    that is hardly possible  because we have not yet penetrated the shell    do not shout at me   i will access the interior meat    bortus  you need some help there   here   cracking   there ya go  buddy    thank you    now we look like fools   insects chirruping   topa  why is that part of the sky glowing green   isaac  it is a phenomenon known as the aurora borealis   when charged particles from the sun collide with the planet s atmosphere   the air molecules are induced into a higher energy state    i have never seen such beauty    the

 sir  thanks    you know  you and gordon should do another song    maybe later    okay    you know  we should ve wiped out the kaylon when we had the chance    you think so    i think we re making a huge mistake  yeah    well  i know you re not alone    captain  do you honestly think they can ever be trusted    i think we need to give the armistice a chance    then you must think i m a lousy person    no  i don t   i think you re a hell of an officer   who s made tremendous strides since you came on board   i know it hasn t been easy    it s not that i think they re   all evil   timmis proved they can change and   so did isaac   but the rest of them  i mean   it s not like we helped them toward some  great moral awakening   we forced their hand   what if they find a weakness   i mean  that s it  we ve blown our only chance to save ourselves    well  it s a fundamental tenet of union philosophy   that we don t kill unless we have to   we didn t have to    i just hope those high minded morals don t kill us     dramatic music playing     indistinct chatter    sub level 32   elevator whirring    can i help you    i have orders to transport the device to another site    we haven t received any new orders    that s strange  you should have received them an hour ago   check your security logs     intense music playing     we don t have much time   gears clang   team echo here we ve accessed the device   on our way to you   deep garbled voice acknowledged     dramatic music playing      hey  good morning    hi there didn t want to miss the sunrise   claire wow  that is really beautiful   the sun rising on a new era  isn t it    sure seems that way   you know  ever since we lost the moclans   i ve had this pit in my stomach about the kaylon   wondering how much time we have left   when are they coming for us   and now   it s all over    so what are we gonna stress about    today  hangovers    ugh  no kidding   it s mornings like this i m jealous of talla    no liver  yep    yeah  we were born on the wrong planet   comm beeping   beeping continues    commander    admiral  hi  is ed with you    he s  still sleeping what s going on    wake him and gather your team the device has been taken     ominous music playing       martial music playing      you are late   was there a problem    nothing i couldn t handle    and the weapon    it s in the shuttle    secure it    i see you ve found a new friend    friends are scarce these days    well  that s what happens   when your government sanctions kidnapping and torture    true to his ethics even as he commits treason   what a noble creature    this is not treason   quite the opposite   i believe in the idealism of the union   but my compatriots have made a grave mistake   sooner or later  the kaylon   will figure out a defense against this weapon   and we will lose our tactical advantage   the union won t do what needs to be done   i know you will    if this weapon is everything you profess  admiral   i can promise you the swift extinction of the kaylon    the device does not come with an instruction manual   at the moment  the only ones who know how to use it   are isaac and ensign burke   i wish i could help you there   your scientists are just gonna have to do some reverse engineering    a facility has already been prepared    well  then there s nothing more to be said    and what does a union admiral do with himself   after the illegal bestowment of such largesse    go back to earth   and turn myself in     martial music playing      he will inform the union of our alliance    they will learn soon enough   it will strike fear into the hearts of many    it will   but  there is no need to rush the revelation     dramatic music playing     explosion    i spoke to the guards on duty last night   there was no forced entry beyond this point   whoever did this had fleet level command codes   halsey  you can stop searching   at 2300 hours  an unscheduled shuttle left the dockyard   on a heading for krill space under this authorization    my god    he didn t report in this morning and no one can find him    there s your fleet level codes    why would he do this    i didn t want to believe it either   but perry s view of the council s decision was no secret   he s always been a healthy voice of dissent   among the more progressive elements of the admiralty   but who the hell would ve thought   he d throw his whole life away to defend it    if his intention is to try and use the device    we need answers   fast     intense music playing      we re approaching the shuttle s projected coordinates    drop to sublight    anything   isaac  i am detecting carbonate and metallo silicate particulates    space dust    or debris    scans indicate traces of union alloys  as well   and residual weapons signatures    what kind of weapons    they appear to be krill   and moclan    isaac  verify scan   isaac  confirmed data is accurate    oh  jesus    an alliance    molotov ribbentrop all over again    it was only a matter of time    this is bad   this is really bad    perry was delivering the device   to the people he knew wouldn t hesitate to use it    but they don t have isaac and charly how do they expect to figure it out    they will seek dr  kalba   he is a weapons expert of great renown   many consider him to be the most brilliant moclan scientist who ever lived   if i had acquired the device i would take it to him    where    he is the director of a research outpost on draconis 427   moclus may have closed the facility since their expulsion from the union   if not  that is where we will find him    set a course  best possible speed     dramatic music playing     gordon malloy  please tell me our jamming systems are going full blast   bortus  affirmative   however  i would not recommend we remain here long    given the number of battleships in orbit   i d say there s something important down there    the facility is operational   i am detecting a substantial power source    what kind of power source    it appears to be a quantum core   one of the largest i have ever seen    captain  if the core s big enough   it could extend the weapon s range by thousands of light years    everything they d need to wipe out the kaylon    we re gonna need some help     intense music playing     kaylon primary is this your concept of humor    unfortunately  no   kaylon primary  then your carelessness has jeopardized our continued existence   you must recover the weapon immediately    god  you know  there is so much irony in that  but i ll stay focused   if the krill and the moclans have joined forces   it means the balance of power has shifted   in open warfare  the union fleet wouldn t stand a chance   kaylon primary you are proposing an alliance    we ve already spoken with union central   they re prepared to send every available ship   with you on our side we can devise a battle plan   to break through their defenses   infiltrate the outpost and recover the device    but we need to act fast   while we still have the element of surprise   that is  assuming you re with us   kaylon primary given your evident incompetence   we may be better served to retrieve the weapon on our own    works for me   isaac if the weapon has been armed   you will require the presence of myself or ensign burke to disable it    what ll it be   kaylon primary  once again you leave us with no alternative   we agree to this   temporary alliance    i m pleased to hear it   we ll be transmitting rendezvous coordinates   don t be late     dramatic music playing       martial music playing      welcome aboard the orville   if you ll follow us we ll escort you to the conference room   kaylon primary we are familiar with its location   as you recall  we occupied this vessel during our previous encounter    i do   and as you recall  we kicked your asses   come on   kaylon primary  how do you intend to retrieve the device    the quantum core is located 500 meters inside the southeast perimeter   unfortunately  the chamber is deep underground and heavily fortified    if we can penetrate the interior   isaac and i can scan for the location of the device   it shouldn t be too far from the core    the question is  how do we get in    there is an emergency tunnel that connects to the surface   i believe that is the best option    in order to get the ground team down there unnoticed   we ll need a big distraction   which means engaging their ships in orbit    a squadron of pterodons will provide cover for the shuttle   once inside we ll locate and extract the weapon   kaylon primary and if extraction is not possible    then we ll have to destroy it    lamarr and malloy will be heading up the pterodon squadron    i ll be leading the ground team   along with isaac  ensign burke and commander keyali    the combined union and kaylon fleets   will engage the krill and the moclans as long as we need to   any questions   kaylon primary  i will accompany the ground mission    i had assumed that you would be leading the kaylon fleet   kaylon primary  kaylon secondary will command our forces    we already have one kaylon we don t need another   kaylon primary on the contrary   isaac has proven he is not to be trusted    we trust isaac   we don t trust you   kaylon primary  you misplaced the weapon once before   i intend to ensure it does not happen again    you follow every one of kelly s orders to the letter   or she s authorized to shoot you   got it    just stay on my good side and you ll be fine  hon   kaylon primary  very well     martial music playing      captain  ships approaching    what ships    union vessels  heavily armed    show me     dramatic music

so   only problem is  when this thing blows   it s gonna take out the entire outpost and a good chunk of the planet with it   you should go    what   charly  we re not leaving without you set up a

please clarify    there s nothing to clarify i just answered your question   kaylon primary this reasoning is unsound   please explain    she sacrificed herself so that the kaylon could live   kaylon

just for your world but for thousands of others    in return  we will expect a full defensive commitment   against the newly formed moclan krill alliance   kaylon primary we have reviewed   the organizational structure of your council   and its history of deliberations   what you call  representative democracy is a most inefficient form of governance    maybe   but the one thing you can say for democracy   is that all other forms of government are even worse   over thousands of years and on countless planets   it s the best system anyone s ever come up with   to ensure the strong don t

pursuit of peace   no   medal   can bring her back   but we can acknowledge our debt   to an outstanding union officer   and an extraordinary human being   who would like to speak first   isaac  i wish to speak     dr  finn assisted me with the construct of my statement   however  the substance is my own   i presume it will be adequate   ensign burke loved pancakes   she consumed them with butter but no syrup   and was indifferent to the addition of berries or other condiments   as a child  pancakes were her favorite breakfast   i served with ensign burke for 257 days   17 minutes  and 49 seconds   and yet  my understanding of her remained incomplete   she had an impressive brain for a biological   she perceived the universe in ways others could not   ensign burke regarded me as an enemy   yet despite her animosity   she chose to save my life when no one else was able   and in the final seconds of her own life   ensign burke substantiated for all the galaxy her true nature   one of integrity and selflessness   and in her sacrifice   she inspired the enemies of the union to become friends   her existence was brief   but  much like the first domino in a succession   her impact will be felt far into the future     contemplative music playing       theme song playing       fanfare playing     please rate this subtitle at www osdb link ah9jx \"\n        ],\n

more music playing please rate this subtitle at www osdb link ahrcs \",\n          \" elizabeth previously on madam secretary we re renewing our vows the hour the minute we picked has significance it was the minute that we both knew that we were getting married 8 22 it was actually this joke that i told that really sealed the deal agh legalization of marijuana is the best way for the us to weaken the mexican cartels jay arizona governor barker implemented a new policy of separating children from parents who illegally cross the border i am against the federal government undermining a state s authority to regulate its own border come on senator there are a million reasons the federal government has to be in charge of the border you are trespassing on arizona state property if desperate asylum seekers aren t free from being detained unfairly in this state why should i sighs i guess you re accustomed to this sort of thing oh christ i meant social justice not jesus i just said christ and jesus my mother always said don t call him unless you need him so i think it s appropriate chuckles and yes it isn t my first arrested for protesting rodeo but it is the first time with a presidential cabinet member well we did what we had to do i think it was saint augustine who said in the absence of justice what is sovereignty but organized robbery my husband is a religious scholar i m well aware i consider him a foremost authority on saint francis whispers that is so gonna make his day both chuckle i understand speaking out but why did you allow yourself to get arrested i have to believe you have some connections what i saw in that detention center crossed a line i never thought our country would cross and i felt obligated to make the world pay attention i feel like the soul of our country is at stake i agree and souls are my business mccord elizabeth adams that s me turn to the side russell not exactly how we drew it up cable news is losing its mind and this may very well be the meme that breaks the internet governor barker s gone too far yeah what else is new i m sorry but this is what happens when a self promoting dc hating malignant narcissist gets his paws on a national issue and we should have anticipated it the arrest is drawing attention to the issue well fantastic the families are still separated the mexican border deal is dead president zaragoza is talking un resolutions against us and practically sending troops to the arizona border and our once popular future president secretary of state is behind bars i m not sure how much attention all that s worth professor russell history has taught us that we must confront injustice head on when we find it that s exactly what elizabeth is doing what by wandering miles beyond her mandate as secretary of state literally i would argue that what she is doing is precisely her mandate she swore to uphold the constitution arizona s separation policy represents an institutional erosion of civil and human rights it threatens our way of life i don t like what barker s doing any more than you do but there s more than one way to skin a cat mainly not in jail jail might be precisely the way to skin this cat because it is noisy look the bellwether of a crumbling democracy is always a violation of human rights look at nazi germany north korea ghana under kwame nkrumah iraq under saddam hussein it s a little premature to be lamenting the death of our democracy that is exactly what everyone said in those countries as human rights eroded fine but your wife is torching her chances of becoming president and saving our franchise from lunatics like barker those mug shots won t exactly look good on a campaign poster but you can bet her opponents will be printing them up on t shirts enough how do we put a stop to barker and reunite the families right now i m considering sending in the national guard sir uh i think that would be playing right into barker s hands i agree he s already elevated his stature by taking on elizabeth who the hell outside of arizona even heard of this guy before today henry that s right now that this has blown up mr president any attention from you will give him even more notoriety well what then i need a plan of attack sighs unfortunately i think it s best not to attack sir better to avoid a public showdown let this fire burn itself out meanwhile we work to get elizabeth released and deescalate the situation and focus on fighting the family separations in court fine sighs let s send an army of white house lawyers to handle it i d like to send mike b to represent elizabeth personally and i m gonna go down there too of course fresh printouts i divided them into domestic and international oh and the mug shot is officially a meme fantastic no shooting the messenger hey stevie hey russell wanted me to give you these talking points before the press conference yeah i got his email you didn t need to hand deliver it i actually kind of wanted an excuse to get in here i need your help it s not about anything happening today it s for the party the vow renewal this is me staring incredulously at you even before i know what the problem is the band canceled at the last minute and i can t find anyone to replace them you re worried about a band when your mother is in jail mike b is on that i m sure that she will be out in no time but this party is unstoppable i was thinking remembering really last year when you and blake and jay sang at our holiday party no why not because that was people singing around a piano for atmosphere you did notice the significant lack of dancing maybe if you guys picked up the pace okay even if i thought it was a good idea i don t have time to learn a bunch of songs why don t you hire a dj it just feels so impersonal stevie if your mother gets out of jail in time i m sure she ll be happy with spotify sorry i gotta go it s just that it s tomorrow night and they really want a band laser dawn was perfect they were one of the top cover bands in dc specializing in 70s covers including and especially peter frampton s baby i love your way which is my mom s favorite really not judging also bee gees how deep is your love huh so now i m just like on my knees to all these second rate bands and i m just getting nothing but no even knowing who your mom is well i didn t tell them that i thought i wasn t supposed to are you kidding me lead with that it s the only way to get anything done in this town aim higher girl okay thanks reporter how long will the secretary be in jail daisy secretary mccord was acting on behalf of the administration in spanish api opensubtitles org is deprecated please implement rest api from opensubtitles com are you okay i m fine yeah when i told you to focus on voter intensity this isn t what i had in mind can we just whistle past the reprimand please fine i have arranged for you a plea deal you plead guilty to misdemeanor trespass you ll be released immediately with a small fine oh god this isn t mute with gratitude is it i can t plead guilty you so can you plead guilty not only does it go against my integrity but it sets a bad precedent with respect to federal authority i was just doing my job i was escorting a foreign dignitary to check on his citizens okay well just so you and your integrity are aware you will be charged with felony trespass and you can kiss potus goodbye it s not lost on me mike i have a few dozen calls to make i ll let you think about that henry the faces of those kids the world has to see that they have to really get it and if i if i plead guilty the headlines will pull to the wrong thing but you have to consider what you ve already accomplished people are aware and you can do a lot more good outside of jail not to mention the good you can do in the world as president are you willing to risk that the viral mug shot s probably already blown that out of the water that s just an image that ll go away a felony conviction that s another matter whispers whose side are you on i support any decision you make you ve got to follow your conscience jfk said there s something immoral about abandoning your own judgment i think that was jfk the movie either way it s a good point it is calling case number 3247 the people of the state of arizona versus elizabeth mccord applause whooping gavel bangs order please i know this is exciting but pipe down folks good afternoon judge collins harley johnson on behalf of the people michael barnow for secretary mccord quietly god help me good afternoon secretary mccord good afternoon your honor how do you plead to the charge of one count misdemeanor criminal trespass it s not too late to talk about this don t need to not guilty in that case judge since defendant is not availing herself of our plea offer the people would like to proceed with one charge of felony criminal trespass understood how do you plead to that ma am bess for the love of god not guilty gasps mike groans sorry about him your honor i ve had worse now out of respect for your position as secretary of state i order you released from custody immediately on your own recognizance no bail provided that you promise to appear for all future courtroom proceedings no your honor bess come on excuse me ma am are you refusing my my order i mean no disrespect your honor but i m going to refuse to leave prison until all the detained children are reunited with their parents cheers applause okay then and your honor if you don t mind can i just say a couple of words before i go to jail go for it no one should rest until this inhumane practice is stopped all arizonans all americans should make their voices heard in fact i am certain that if every american could see what is happening inside the arizona state detention facility in sasabe they would do everything they could to end it because this is not who we are cheering thank you your honor i appreciate it yeah okay then trial date s set for one week from today russell suddenly she s gandhi and joan of arc all rolled into one only now she s martyring the whole damn administration excuse me jay whitman great the crack team leader what the hell happened to you well i was playing basketball oh forget it i don t care look the secretary is torching her storied career and now we the grown ups have to wall off the rest of the state department and the administration limit the blast radius by disavowing her actions she s standing up for the rights of children russell said the man who can barely stand sit down already i have no quibble with what s in her heart my problem is she s flying solo when we all need to be rowing together i m aware of the mixed metaphor the point is if she s going down in flames she is not gonna take the administration with her and if that hearing is any indication her trial next week is gonna be a three ring media circus which is bad for the business of government we need a nice choral trio polite ordered calming people get nervous when their government s devouring the headlines it s bad for the country arizona s child separation policy is worse it demands a noisy response maybe even a circus i didn t call you here for your opinion too bad groans for god s sake sit down say what you want to say the president should issue a statement of support for the secretary get behind her because some issues transcend politics as usual and demand a response whoa stop you think i don t care about what s going on with those kids if i had my way governor barker would be on his way to the hague but this is about process and what s best for our democracy i couldn t agree more okay look you might be in my shoes one day soon the point is the job isn t about doing what s right it s about doing what s best and that is right is cynicism a prerequisite for the job cynical pragmatism looking at every issue from every possible angle all at once and then figuring out what s best for the country okay so no one s leaving this room until we re all on the same page now where are we on challenging arizona s detention policy adele sorry but you need to see this what she was arrested again a guard from the arizona detention center just released it children coughing crying russell sighs deeply holy mother of god security buzzer child mama and he made a statement to the press if the secretary of state is willing to go to jail to shed light on this situation then i can t stay silent the world needs to know and now they do i stand with secretary mccord cheering okay now that changes things dalton public opinion is turning against you governor the latest snap poll taken in the last hour shows that 90 of americans are against family separations i don t govern by polls mr president fair enough but i think we can agree that your sheriff took things too far by arresting secretary mccord no sir law s the law none of us is above it clearly we don t see eye to eye on much but how about this i can offer you a seat at the table with a coalition of border governors to provide meaningful input on the border security deal with mexico we both know that s what this is really about and i m willing to compromise providing you reunite the families and release secretary mccord today let s get past this ugliness and work together you think my base wants compromise i get 10 000 folks at my rallies in tucson they are tired of namby pamby politicians willing to sell their souls based on the latest poll now you want a deal here it is rip up that feckless immigration bill you signed over the summer then we can get real about border security you know that s not going to happen governor then i guess we have nothing to talk about son of a bitch he wants to go to war fine i want all options on the table i can t worry about how much attention this brings to barker we have to end this even if it means getting in the mud i say we go after the man directly personally take him in investigate his taxes don t tempt me look if we re gonna do this quickly we need to draw blood there has to be some federal statute somewhere that barker s breaking by detaining all these people extrajudicially okay you really wanna ratchet things up and play hard ball we argue that this current policy barker is enforcing is beyond the scope of his mandate as chief executive of the state to what end well normally a sitting governor is shielded from personal liability as long as he s acting in his official capacity but we argue that this separation policy is such an egregious violation of human rights and so completely outside the scope of the state s domain that by definition barker is acting beyond his role as governor by ordering it and we charge him with kidnapping isn t that a bit of a stretch russell no it s a lot of a stretch i like it dalton get it in the works i m done with this bastard sure i ll send you all of the details in an email and hopefully we can confirm tomorrow morning that would be great all right bye bye we smelled dinner sighs you smelled more than that you smelled success hm it smells a lot like vegan chili guys i think i just got epic dreamscape don t worry i think they re close to finding a cure that s a band i hope that is not just a band it is the best wedding band in town this is gonna happen i m glad you ve made progress because jason and i are nowhere on our project yeah because you rejected my stand up comedy idea and now you re rejecting my mad libs idea because they both equally sucked what guys well the poem is now the only missing piece i m just more of a visual person i m more of a this is a dumb idea person move move move why don t we just try to do something with dad s stupid joke like the exact time of it phone buzzing what rhymes with 8 22 avian flu stevie oh my god i do not believe this i sent out a hail mary to laser dawn asking if they would consider reuniting for the secretary of state and they said yes we just went from having no band to being double booked ooh and apparently healing the wounds of laser dawn we are the world dude oh man daisy wasn t kidding about aiming higher hey i got the basket from win thanks for sending it over daisy he wants you to know he didn t injure you on purpose and he still wants a sit down with m sec i m sure he does did nolan really pitch charging barker with kidnapping potus is champing at the bit what s the latest there the narrative has shifted in her favor which is good but she s still locked up it s uncharted territory how s the leg it hurts like hell doc says it ll feel like this for a few days i know i m not getting any sleep tonight you should take something you have to be on your game tomorrow it s gonna be a big day yeah i know i ll think about it all right take care you too space jammies indica gummies thc pain cream jay marijuana edibles no way all those baby goats have pajamas bleating because they re cold oh why don t all farm

man automated voice hello you have a collect call from an inmate of the arizona penitentiary beep elizabeth elizabeth mccord agh man to accept say yes to decline say no groaning to accept yes yes god yes ma am hey took you a minute there promise i ll pay you back no it s not that i just got confused you don t call me from jail every day i mean nobody does i mean not that that jail s bad how are you i m fine i they let me make phone calls whenever i want they let henry get some clothes to me and they ve even put a divider around my bed so i have privacy i m fine laughs jay oh sorry it s the image you sound a little weird i m sorry ma am these are weird times can t argue with that listen now that public opinion has swung so decisively against the family separation policy i think it s worth taking another crack at convincing morejon to help out with the legislative option unlike barker he has national ambitions and he can t afford to define his base so narrowly sure yeah we yeah it s worth a try we don t really have a choice i heard you were in the room when the ag suggested whispers going after barker for kidnapping and i think that if we don t do something soon potus will call in the national guard and that ll trigger the biggest federal state showdown since the civil war wow yeah so meet with morejon first thing in the morning and just in case the shift in public opinion isn t enough try to come up with i don t know some extra angle or an inducement that can win him over yeah okay uh yeah okay i ll get started on that like now sorry to ruin your night what do you mean what do you mean i mean that you re gonna have to work late and yeah no i mean that s that s my pleasure it s my job it s my job thank you that s i ll talk to you soon mm bye oh my god that was hard phone ringing kat hey jay what s up i m on a kind of painkiller congratulations i don t know if this idea where are you i am driving to aguila to visit my father oh that s probably not gonna be easy how long has it been it s been a couple of years i m uh just hoping for the best okay good luck thanks what s your idea what oh right m sec wants me to meet with morejon to take another swing at the legislative option i wanna know if this idea is good crazy or jay you re fired crazy chuckling okay all right let s hear it did you know studies have shown that thc outperforms most prescription sedatives and has no side effects did not know yeah get me ten minutes with your boss i promise she ll love you for it you might even end up with her job when she s promoted sorry to interrupt tight window pal oh hey buddy look here s my card call anytime let s get this done i m feeling it do you ever stop i m blessed love pot believe in what i preach thanks for doing this on short notice phone chimes anytime brother psyched to be recruited into the fight the senator is about to get out of a presidential advisory commission meeting love it i m the king of the ambush not that i ever ambushed you that s always a coincidence just yeah mm must be how a predator feels huh hm waiting ever so patiently in the tall grass to pounce i m a lion jay for my country just don t screw this up door opens wait for it the senior advisor mm hm okay now hey uh senator what a coincidence how s that i was about to call you but if you have a sec now i d love to run something by you sure first i wanna apologize for the other night okay emotions have been running high mine especially and i d just really like you to know that i respect that you re in a tough spot okay but now the whole country including most of arizona is rallying behind m sec and outraged by the policy so i d like to revisit the idea of you sponsoring a bill to force governor barker s hand my position has not changed if i may senator i think i have a way for you to help reunite the families and still be tough on immigration how s that i read every speech you ve given in ten years about illegal immigration and you always say the biggest underlying cause is the flow of drugs across the border that s right i have someone i d like you to meet this is win barrington the pot lobbyist laughs my mom reacted pretty much the same way when i told her what i was doing so i get it but senator there is no better way to defang the syndicates and gangs trafficking over our borders than to take away their biggest market well the kingpins are terrified of legalization not only would it cripple their business it would significantly curtail the flow of all illicit drugs over the border legalization of marijuana in certain states is already weakening the mexican drug cartels and marijuana grown legally in the us is cheaper and better than what the cartels are smuggling over the border which is effectively pricing the cartels out i don t make policies based on theories mr barrington where s the evidence oh you re right that s my bad some people get spun by data but here are the numbers ten years ago us customs and border patrol seized over four million pounds of marijuana at the border last year it was down to less than a million and with less cartel activity violent crime in border states that have legalized marijuana has gone down an average of 13 that s why marijuana legalization is directly linked to stronger border security 861 231 pounds of marijuana were seized at us ports of entry in versus 2 4 million pounds in and 4 3 million pounds in 2009 okay what does this have to do with me sponsoring a bill to pressure the governor you can sponsor two bills be the maverick who reaches across the aisle with a humane solution to family separation and a creative solution to get tough on immigration hold your base and expand it to a broader demo not only that the marijuana lobby is incredibly well funded one of my biggest initiatives as their chief lobbyist is to figure out where best to invest those funds you have a tough reelection coming up i d like to win okay so what do you say senator in spanish i speak english you don t have to treat me like a peasant okay well i don t i don t look at it that way i m proud of both my languages and cultures this is your culture now how you go around in the world sighs i was talking about the irish side your mother always so wild how could you turn out any other way what are you talking about she wanted me to go to cotillion i m not the progeny either of you had in mind how is she still in florida doing community theater probably happy she always thought she was a star too good for me and this place that you got from her moving all over washington california hey politics avocados okay writing a book airing out all your dirty laundry my laundry is pretty clean actually so telling the world who you wanna sleep with yeah yeah you like girls you like boys what is your daughter supposed to think desi s fine by the way thank you for asking no i m not doing this it s not why i m here clears throat look i am here come on you ve seen the news things aren t good here and i m just i m worried about you i have a green card i m legal never have i worked here illegally i know and there was a time when that would have been enough but uh you know what these days i m not so sure i would feel better if you had citizenship i brought the forms i filled them all out all you have to do is um sign and initial a couple of places and then send them in okay once you re in the system you re more protected okay tell me you ll do it tell me you ll do it in spanish in spanish sighs you know what i was born this way but i was also raised by a father who encouraged me to live my life on my own terms and that s exactly what i m doing security buzzer henry babe you in there oh my god yes oh i am so happy to see you hi hi hi hi hi that s quite a set up how are you holding up i m okay i m okay yeah i just got some news that uh morejon has agreed to sponsor the bill putting pressure on arizona to end that family separation policy so they re fast tracking it to the floor it looks like they ll have enough votes that s incredible how did you pull that off jay and a very passionate pot lobbyist who actually caused jay s basketball injury trying to get a sit down with me do you really want me to keep talking nope i just i m glad it worked out yeah well it s not entirely worked out though barker is threatening to fight the bill in court as an unconstitutional violation of the commandeering doctrine under the tenth amendment so we may lose support from senators afraid of triggering a constitutional crisis well don t go there yet barker might just be posturing yeah well he s got pretty good follow through too you know chuckles you realize we re not gonna get back in time for the vow renewal i know and i m so sorry henry i

awaits the honor of your attention show them in ambassador welcome to krill thank you for receiving us chancellor we do not get many visitors i can only assume you have come with good reason that is for you to decide i am told that moclus has been expelled from the planetary union it was inevitable the union imposes its values on other cultures while refusing to confront its own hypocrisy a governance of elitist fools on that we agree moclus and krill however have much to offer one another in these dangerous times we have confirmed reports that the kaylon are amassing thousands of ships the pattern of deployment suggests they are preparing to launch a full scale invasion teleya i am aware of the threat the worlds in closest proximity are vikarris and xelayah they will likely be the first targets and when those worlds are reduced to ashes who will be next you propose an alliance what exactly do you offer moclus was the primary manufacturer of armaments for the union what we provided them can be provided to any ally and what do you expect in return the protection of your superior fleet our two great militaries would ensure a formidable defense against the kaylon and any other union of militaries who may oppose us indeed who would lead this alliance naturally we would on what basis you are a female any other arrangement would be offensive scoffs how surprising that the union revoked your membership i must admit however that i admire your hubris to enter the dominion of a foreign power and suggest the wholesale submission of its entire military industrial complex there is a phrase i once heard uttered by a human helmsman aboard the union ship orville you have got balls it is the only acceptable arrangement i will consider your proposal for alliance under one condition a partnership of command i will need to consult with my government your weapons may be superior but as tacticians you leave much to be desired i have studied your battle strategies they are blunt and maladroit you lack the cunning and intellect of the female mind i will provide this all command decisions will be shared equally or there will be no alliance do i make myself clear yes chancellor i await your decision theme song playing intense music playing defensive line is moving into position nineteen kaylon ships just dropped out of quantum ten million kilometers and closing general quarters all hands battle stations bridge to engineering what s your status the device is drawing steady power from the quantum core it ll be fully armed in about two minutes sir power surging ed mercer isaac prepare to initiate on my command isaac yes sir dramatic music playing captain another 42 ships just dropped out of quantum jesus they re all around us charly how soon charly burke about 30 seconds captain mercer signal all ships to tighten formation aye sir burke device is fully armed sir isaac initiate power surging alarm buzzing isaac isaac to bridge were we successful yes isaac you could say that contemplative music playing light music playing you two have done a great service for the union for the first time in over a year we can all breathe a sigh of relief isaac the combination of my superior intellect and ensign burke s capacity for multi dimensional visualization was sufficient for the development of this technology we worked together yes but how did you accomplish it so quickly for great achievements two things are needed a plan and not quite enough time churchill isaac leonard bernstein can this device be used on a larger scale isaac the radius of destruction is limited only by the amount of power available the orville s quantum core was sufficient to destroy all kaylon vessels within a radius of ten million kilometers so in principle it could go even farther yes sir given a sufficient power source the range would be unlimited and none of our ships or people would be affected no sir isaac and i discovered their achilles heel by studying the kaylon the orville found on situla four every kaylon and every one of their ships is connected through a synchronization matrix that s how they coordinate all their actions even across light years of space and that s how you got inside the kaylon network isaac correct the device uses quantum energy to trigger a feedback loop in its interlink chain basically it turns the relays into a row of dominoes knock one down they all go down isaac after the initiation sequence is transmitted it cannot be countermanded and what about you why weren t your systems damaged i am no longer connected to the synchronization matrix this is better than we ever could ve hoped for our priority now should be to build a quantum core that can maximize the weapon s range and eradicate the kaylon threat completely yes sir we can get to work on your order uh well now wait a second with all due respect we re being very cavalier about this aren t we i mean you do realize what you re talking about is is genocide isaac was tasked with developing a weapon that could defeat the kaylon he exceeded our expectations we d be fools not to use it and is it really genocide if our only objective is to prevent them from killing every other living species including us admiral we ve seen first hand that the kaylon are capable of change and growth our experience with timmis yes i read your report about the emotive kaylon it proves they can evolve it proves nothing that kaylon didn t evolve on its own it was modified by a cyberneticist and correct me if i m wrong but it didn t work with isaac here isaac that is correct my capacity to experience emotion was only temporary captain mercer if you think that we can enlist and train an army of cyberneticists to teach empathy to ten billion kaylon i d love to hear your plan look all i m saying is that we have created a weapon of unparalleled destructive power and i just think that before we go cracking eggshells with a sledgehammer we need to consider the moral implications i agree this is an unprecedented situation with profound ethical questions but how we proceed won t be decided in this room it s a matter for the union council until they make a determination there s nothing more to say tranquil music playing you re kidding me right what is there to even talk about i mean it s just a big decision how is it a big decision they want us all dead we want to stay alive that s a pretty basic equation it s us or them yeah i know the kaylon got a raw deal back home but i gotta say i agree with charly plus the fact that we re sitting ducks since we kicked the moclans out john lamarr look charly don t get me wrong as an engineer i am blown away by what you and isaac were able to do here but i also understand why people are taking a minute i agree we re talking about exterminating an entire species i can t think of anything that runs more contrary to union values and let s be goddamn clear about the motive are we doing this to save ourselves or is this revenge my dad used to say revenge is for children and savages yeah well he never had his leg cut off oh come on man it s a joke it s not funny sorry look i know isaac s your best pal so maybe you re a little biased hey watch it ensign i gotta get back to duty if we d had this weapon a year ago and used it amanda might still be alive we built it we tested it it works let s wipe em off the face of the galaxy contemplative music playing that was the most heated session i ve ever witnessed but the union council has reached a compromise they ve decided we should use the weapon as a deterrent meaning what exactly according to napoleon the whole of war is to frighten your enemy into submission ideally without fighting he was a tyrant but he was accurate on that point we will travel to kaylon to reveal the nature of the device and our willingness to use it they saw what happened to their invasion force at xelayah if nothing else the kaylon are logical beings it should persuade them to accept an immediate and absolute cease fire and if they refuse our terms we re authorized to use the weapon again to make our point clear martial music playing captain we re approaching the kaylon system go to tactical alert five kaylon vessels on an intercept course bridge to engineering everything ready we re at full power mercer stand by to initiate on my command intense music playing hail them alert chimes channel open this is admiral thomas halsey of the planetary union we are here on a mission of peace i wish to speak with kaylon primary they are powering weapons we re armed with the weapon we deployed during our last confrontation stand down or we will be forced to use it again engineering initiate power surging ships exploding proceed to kaylon with pleasure sir engineering initiate sir we are being hailed let s hear it kaylon primary this is kaylon primary we will receive you transmitting landing coordinates got em stand down tactical alert take us down uneasy music playing epic music playing kaylon primary kaylon primary that is correct you look better than the last time we saw you kaylon primary a kaylon s neural matrix can be regenerated indefinitely an advantage biologicals do not have state your demands our demands are simple end your campaign to exterminate us stop your attacks against our ships and our worlds recall your vessels and cease all further weapons construction we will place monitoring stations inside your territory to verify your compliance kaylon primary do you intend to enslave us of course not we re not here to conquer you we just want to end the violence and establish a basis for peaceful coexistence kaylon primary how do we know this is not a deception we could ve killed every one of you without warning we didn t kaylon primary why because we re not the monsters you think we are we believe the quality of mercy is mightiest in the mightiest regardless deception or not you don t have a choice trust us or be destroyed it s a simple binary decision kaylon primary we have no defense against your weapon therefore we will surrender to your demands it may not seem like it now but one day you ll realize that you ve made the right decision kaylon primary we will find a weakness in your weapon trust me it s a bad idea for you to go looking isaac any attempt to disable the weapon will immediately activate it kaylon primary there is always a weakness isaac your existence is proof of that i ll inform the union council that you ve agreed to our terms we ll work out the details of the armistice in the coming weeks i imagine we ll be seeing each other again soon kaylon primary indeed peaceful guitar music playing through the corridors of sleep past shadows dark and deep my mind dances in leaps and confusion i don t know what is real i can t touch what i feel and i hide behind the shield of my illusion so i ll continue to continue to pretend my life will never end and flowers never bend with the rainfall no matter if you re born ooh ooh to play the king or pawn ooh ooh for the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow so my fantasy becomes reality and i must be what i must be and face tomorrow so i ll continue to continue to pretend my life will never end and flowers never bend with the rainfall whoo i told you this gal could sing right hey listen i just wanna congratulate this crew on the key role you all played in this i would say this may be the single greatest step toward the cause of galactic peace in our lifetimes and you should all feel insanely proud of yourselves even gordon laughter thank you thanks a lot so this is a rare bottle of very old rum from the 21st century my dad told me it was only to be opened for the most special of occasions and if he were still with us today i think he d give this one the thumbs up so here s to you dad and let s get hammered yeah cheers jazzy guitar music playing kel this place is so beautiful god i d wanna spend all my time here forget space yeah my dad left it in good condition ed and i used to come here during the holidays when we were married it s been a while i miss it yeah i bet i told you you are doing it wrong i am doing it exactly as i was shown that is hardly possible because we have not yet penetrated the shell do not shout at me i will access the interior meat bortus you need some help there here cracking there ya go buddy thank you now we look like fools insects chirruping topa why is that part of the sky glowing green isaac it is a phenomenon known as the aurora borealis when charged particles from the sun collide with the planet s atmosphere the air molecules are induced into a higher energy state i have never seen such beauty the earth s full of surprises huh hey isaac show her the big dipper isaac an asterism in the constellation ursa major whirring door creaks open mercer hey you all right yeah i m fine sir thanks you know you and gordon should do another song maybe later okay you know we should ve wiped out the kaylon when we had the chance you think so i think we re making a huge mistake yeah well i know you re not alone captain do you honestly think they can ever be trusted i think we need to give the armistice a chance then you must think i m a lousy person no i don t i think you re a hell of an officer who s made tremendous strides since you came on board i know it hasn t been easy it s not that i think they re all evil timmis proved they can change and so did isaac but the rest of them i mean it s not like we helped them toward some great moral awakening we forced their hand what if they find a weakness i mean that s it we ve blown our only chance to save ourselves well it s a fundamental tenet of union philosophy that we don t kill unless we have to we didn t have to i just hope those high minded morals don t kill us dramatic music playing indistinct chatter sub level 32 elevator whirring can i help you i have orders to transport the device to another site we haven t received any new orders that s strange you should have received them an hour ago check your security logs intense music playing we don t have much time gears clang team echo here we ve accessed the device on our way to you deep garbled voice acknowledged dramatic music playing hey good morning hi there didn t want to miss the sunrise claire wow that is really beautiful the sun rising on a new era isn t it sure seems that way you know ever since we lost the moclans i ve had this pit in my stomach about the kaylon wondering how much time we have left when are they coming for us and now it s all over so what are we gonna stress about today hangovers ugh no kidding it s mornings like this i m jealous of talla no liver yep yeah we were born on the wrong planet comm beeping beeping continues commander admiral hi is ed with you he s still sleeping what s going on wake him and gather your team the device has been taken ominous music playing martial music playing you are late was there a problem nothing i couldn t handle and the weapon it s in the shuttle secure it i see you ve found a new friend friends are scarce these days well that s what happens when your government sanctions kidnapping and torture true to his ethics even as he commits treason what a noble creature this is not treason quite the opposite i believe in the idealism of the union but my compatriots have made a grave mistake sooner or later the kaylon will figure out a defense against this weapon and we will lose our tactical advantage the union won t do what needs to be done i know you will if this weapon is everything you profess admiral i can promise you the swift extinction of the kaylon the device does not come with an instruction manual at the moment the only ones who know how to use it are isaac and ensign burke i wish i could help you there your scientists are just gonna have to do some reverse engineering a facility has already been prepared well then there s nothing more to be said and what does a union admiral do with himself after the illegal bestowment of such largesse go back to earth and turn myself in martial music playing he will inform the union of our alliance they will learn soon enough it will strike fear into the hearts of many it will but there is no need to rush the revelation dramatic music playing explosion i spoke to the guards on duty last night there was no forced entry beyond this point whoever did this had fleet level command codes halsey you can stop searching at 2300 hours an unscheduled shuttle left the dockyard on a heading for krill space under this authorization my god he didn t report in this morning and no one can find him there s your fleet level codes why would he do this i didn t want to believe it either but perry s view of the council s decision was no secret he s always been a healthy voice of dissent among the more progressive elements of the admiralty but who the hell would ve thought he d throw his whole life away to defend it if his intention is to try and use the device we need answers fast intense music playing we re approaching the shuttle s projected coordinates drop to sublight anything isaac i am detecting carbonate and metallo silicate particulates space dust or debris scans indicate traces of union alloys as well and residual weapons signatures what kind of weapons they appear to be krill and moclan isaac verify scan isaac confirmed data is accurate oh jesus an alliance molotov ribbentrop all over again it was only a matter of time this is bad this is really bad perry was delivering the device to the people he knew wouldn t hesitate to use it but they don t have isaac and charly how do they expect to figure it out they will seek dr kalba he is a weapons expert of great renown many consider him to be the most brilliant moclan scientist who ever lived if i had acquired the device i would take it to him where he is the director of a research outpost on draconis 427 moclus may have closed the facility since their expulsion from the union if not that is where we will find him set a course best possible speed dramatic music playing gordon malloy please tell me our jamming systems are going full blast bortus affirmative however i would not recommend we remain here long given the number of battleships in orbit i d say there s something important down there the facility is operational i am detecting a substantial power source what kind of power source it appears to be a quantum core one of the largest i have ever seen captain if the core s big enough it could extend the weapon s range by thousands of light years everything they d need to wipe out the kaylon we re gonna need some help intense music playing kaylon primary is this your concept of humor unfortunately no kaylon primary then your carelessness has jeopardized our continued existence you must recover the weapon immediately god you know there is so much irony in that but i ll stay focused if the krill and the moclans have joined forces it means the balance of power has shifted in open warfare the union fleet wouldn t stand a chance kaylon primary you are proposing an alliance we ve already spoken with union central they re prepared to send every available ship with you on our side we can devise a battle plan to break through their defenses infiltrate the outpost and recover the device but we need to act fast while we still have the element of surprise that is assuming you re with us kaylon primary given your evident incompetence we may be better served to retrieve the weapon on our own works for me isaac if the weapon has been armed you will require the presence of myself or ensign burke to disable it what ll it be kaylon primary once again you leave us with no alternative we agree to this temporary alliance i m pleased to hear it we ll be transmitting rendezvous coordinates don t be late dramatic music playing martial music playing welcome aboard the orville if you ll follow us we ll escort you to the conference room kaylon primary we are familiar with its location as you recall we occupied this vessel during our previous encounter i do and as you recall we kicked your asses come on kaylon primary how do you intend to retrieve the device the quantum core is located 500 meters inside the southeast perimeter unfortunately the chamber is deep underground and heavily fortified if we can penetrate the interior isaac and i can scan for the location of the device it shouldn t be too far from the core the question is how do we get in there is an emergency tunnel that connects to the surface i believe that is the best option in order to get the ground team down there unnoticed we ll need a big distraction which means engaging their ships in orbit a squadron of pterodons will provide cover for the shuttle once inside we ll locate and extract the weapon kaylon primary and if extraction is not possible then we ll have to destroy it lamarr and malloy will be heading up the pterodon squadron i ll be leading the ground team along with isaac ensign burke and commander keyali the combined union and kaylon fleets will engage the krill and the moclans as long as we need to any questions kaylon primary i will accompany the ground mission i had assumed that you would be leading the kaylon fleet kaylon primary kaylon secondary will command our forces we already have one kaylon we don t need another kaylon primary on the contrary isaac has proven he is not to be trusted we trust isaac we don t trust you kaylon primary you misplaced the weapon once before i intend to ensure it does not happen again you follow every one of kelly s orders to the letter or she s authorized to shoot you got it just stay on my good side and you ll be fine hon kaylon primary very well martial music playing captain ships approaching what ships union vessels heavily armed show me dramatic music playing alert the fleet and notify the chancellor assume

ll target us it s either that or we crash what about the egress packs all right let s go group leader to kaylon get your shiny asses down here we need reinforcements energy pulsing kaylon primary at our current altitude of 5 000 meters we will need to achieve terminal velocity before we initiate reverse thrust just hit the button before you hit the ground good luck heroic music playing sir the

suspenseful music playing comscanner beeping i ve got it the quantum core is about 900 meters to the northwest charly there are multiple access routes fastest one will get us there in about six minutes lead the way soldiers speaking in native language weapons firing there s gotta be another way in there s another set of tunnels 50 meters to the south it s the long way around but it ll get us there go take isaac we ll catch up how much longer once the arming sequence begins it will take the device approximately eight minutes to draw sufficient power from the quantum core and then then it will initiate our transmitter array will propagate the signal good work doors open chancellor the facility has been breached deploy all defensive units to the access points dr kalba when i return i expect every kaylon within 10 000 light years to be dead i will do my best chancellor bring the array online energy pulsing the outpost is powering its transmitter array mercer to malloy any chance you can do some damage to those transmitters we got a whole division of krill up our ass but we can sure as hell try malloy to lamarr permission to reconfigure weapons for short range ground strikes go to it weapons firing keep moving i ll cover you lamarr strike team approaching target three krill fighters in pursuit 900 meters to transmitter array aim for the support pylons damn it the

break off captain it s no good the transmitter is too heavily defended we had to withdraw explosion gears clicking groaning kaylon primary move away from your consoles are you dr kalba yes kaylon primary you will terminate the countdown sequence immediately electronics chirping i i cannot why not the firing armature is interlocked with the quantum core it cannot be uncoupled you are too late isaac he is correct you need to shut down the core that would take hours there are multiple fail safe encryptions in place we ll see about that groans intense music playing screaming bones crack you re really starting to piss me off your passions are easily roused this is what cost you your marriage yes not gonna work you need emotional balance and you need a dermatologist power surging isaac the weapon will initiate in 5 3 minutes every time we decrypt a fail safe another one locks in we re not gonna make it kaylon primary what are you doing thinking four dimensionally special talent kaylon primary i do not understand what shut up and let me work kaylon primary why did you not terminate him isaac it was not essential you could learn something from isaac intense music playing a gift for avis took you long enough dramatic music playing report the weapon is gonna initialize in three minutes i can t disable it and i can t shut down the core i m trying to trigger an overload isaac that would effectively destroy the quantum core and the weapon do not be a fool they will kill us all if you get her out of here can you do it i think so only problem is when this thing blows it s gonna take out the entire outpost and a good chunk of the planet with it you should go what charly we re not leaving without you set up a timer delay it s not that simple we ll figure out another way there is no other way i m giving you an order i have my orders commander my orders are to disable this weapon by any means necessary unless you re countermanding those orders step away and let me do my job sir metallic clanging you have two minutes go rumbling get out if you can where s the nearest shuttle that way energy pulsing captain i am detecting a power surge inside the outpost it is the quantum core grayson to orville signal all ships to retreat get the hell away from this planet mercer acknowledged intense music rising energy pulsing burke i m here amanda explosion mercer aft view blast rumbling alert beeps sir a krill shuttle is hailing us put em on shuttle to orville permission to dock granted kelly what happened down there we couldn t disarm the weapon we had to destroy it where s charly we we couldn t bring her home are you okay yeah teleya s in sickbay after claire s done with her talla s gonna take her to the brig you should be in sickbay too i ll be fine so what happens now do you depart peacefully or is this battle not over isaac primary an inquiry has been put to you kaylon primary the biological terminated her existence why to save you kaylon primary please clarify there s nothing to clarify i just answered your question kaylon primary this reasoning is unsound please explain she sacrificed herself so that the kaylon could live kaylon primary why would she do this isaac because these biologicals are not as our builders were it is what i have attempted to communicate they are worthy of preservation they are my friends kaylon primary perhaps we have been incorrect in our assessment she hated you for what you did and she still gave her life for you you re goddamn right you re incorrect tranquil music playing bad pennies will keep turning up won t they you have no right to detain me if we hadn t stopped you you would ve committed genocide that s all the right i need i just wanted to let you know we re taking you back to earth you did not have to come here to tell me that i can t protect you this time and i have no desire to but there s someone you seem to have forgotten about anaya is in safe hands you ll be tried for war crimes after that i don t know what s gonna happen to you but she needs a home i can give her one release me and i will arrange it jesus you are contemptible and you are a sentimental fool i m sentimental because i care what happens to our daughter is that what you re saying you can t just leave her alone the fulfillment of a divine purpose eclipses all family bonds one day anaya will understand this and as long as i am a prisoner i promise you will never see her door opens shuts if you choose to accept joint ratification of an alliance we are prepared to offer kaylon a provisional seat on the union council where you will have a tempered voice in the enactment of policy eventually if you behave in good faith and if the council sees fit you may be offered full membership into the union should you so desire it it s an opportunity to help shape the future not just for your world but for thousands of others in return we will expect a full defensive commitment against the newly formed moclan krill alliance kaylon primary we have reviewed the organizational structure of your council and its history of deliberations what you call representative democracy is a most inefficient form of governance maybe but the one thing you can say for democracy is that all other forms of government are even worse over thousands of years and on countless planets it s the best system anyone s ever come up with to ensure the strong don t dominate the weak at least not for long kaylon speaking machine language kaylon primary we accept your terms tranquil music playing mercer we are gathered here in remembrance of a fallen shipmate one who left us far too soon ensign charly burke will receive the union medal of valor posthumously for her unwavering sense of duty and for the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of peace no medal can bring her back but we can acknowledge our debt to an outstanding union officer and an extraordinary human being who would like to speak first isaac i wish to speak dr finn assisted me with the construct of my statement however the substance is my own i presume it will be adequate ensign burke loved pancakes she consumed them with butter but no syrup and was indifferent to the addition of berries or other condiments as a child pancakes were her favorite breakfast i served with ensign burke for 257 days 17 minutes and 49 seconds and yet my understanding of her remained incomplete she had an impressive brain for a biological she perceived the universe in ways others could not ensign burke regarded me as an enemy yet despite her animosity she chose to save my life when no one else was able and in the final seconds of her own life ensign burke substantiated for all the galaxy her true nature one of integrity and selflessness and in her sacrifice she inspired the enemies of the union to become friends her existence was brief but much like the first domino in a succession her impact will be felt far into the future contemplative music playing theme song playing

      "CHUNK 1:  in the name of god the most gracious the most merciful from muhammad the messenger of god to heraclius the emperor of byzantium greetings to him who is the follower of righteous guidance i bid you to hear the divine call i am the messenger of god to the people accept islam for your salvation he speaks of a new prophet in arabia was it like this when john the baptist came to king herod out of the desert crying about salvation to muqawqis patriarch of alexandria kisra emperor of persia muhammad calls you with the call of god accept islam for your salvation embrace islam you come out of the desert smelling of camel and goat to tell persia where he should kneel muhammad messenger of god who gave him this authority god sent muhammad as a mercy to mankind the scholars and historians of islam the university of al azhar in cairo the high islamic congress of the shiat in lebanon the makers of this film honour the islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message therefore the person of mohammad will not be shown 600 years after christ died when europe was sunk in the dark ages and everywhere the old civilizations were falling muhammad was born in mecca in arabia mecca was then a rich trading city ruled by its merchants whose wealth was multiplied by a unique privilege they housed the gods every year at the time of the great fair the desert priests brought their idols and the images of their gods into the custody of the kaaba once the most holy shrine of abraham the kaaba had now become a house of idolotry hosting no fewer than 360 different gods mecca in 610 a d bilal have you had today s count umaya not yet but this year the gods are gold when you put the gods and prophet together you sit very pretty between hmm and more gods to place in the kaaba caravan from syria hmm they must have been running they ll be thirsty put five more men on north wells how many sheep shall i have to kill for them 70 give them a hundred mecca must keep her name for hospitality and ten lambs for the leaders bread and water do the poets have in the hakim s house where verse and prose are nightly put to slaughter and and the bread i swear in there is thinner than the water oh open the space open the space you lovers of poetry to abu sufian willing and which patron of the arts when abu sofyan invites the poet in their joy is kit and love is kin where wines and cakes abound the skills of abu sofyan all revels and all songs begin when abu sofyan invites the poet in from the silkworms of china my lady a pleasure to the limb and as my lady can see a ravish to the eye yes 7 lengths 20 dinars abu sofyan s wife 15 oh gold the gods of the kaaba have their needs their upkeeps who is that man who stood there who looked into my soul carry me away from here why must muhammad come down here why don t you stop him he is your nephew maybe he will change change he is 40 years old it s unnatural with a rich wife he could afford the best of mecca yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave it is unnatural for a man who dares to risk the anger of al uzza who keeps our health manat the god of our prosperity allat the god of our family and tribes and hubal hubal who starts our caravans and predicts our fate to challenge the gods within earshot of the gods is dangerous unreasonable rebellious blasphemous yes i m afraid muhammad will harm himself i am always sad when the great fair is over i might not see the next one abu talib abu talib catch your breath zaid has muhammad come down from mount hira yet he s been up there three days no no i haven t seen him khadijah hoped he might have come to you on his way home then he s still up there three days i m afraid for him on the mountain because i don t know what it means men see the world too well from a mountain muhammad read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read he s still trembling under the blanket but he has spoken zaid what happened to my nephew on the mountain he was alone in the cave suddenly an angel came in to him the angel said read muhammad replied i can not read the angel commanded again read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read who knows if it was gabriel it could have been a dream when muhammad was coming from the mountain he saw gabriel plainly in the shape of a man standing on the horizon wherever he looked upon every turn of his head he saw him and gabriel said to him again i am gabriel and you muhammad are the messenger of god who has he told about this his wife and ali and his friend abu bakr and you i am his adopted son be careful to whom you talk tell him his uncle who protected him when he was a child will protect him still after all they say the god of moses spoke to him out of a burning bush if you do not restrain your nephew then we will he s dividing the city heart against house he s dividing the generations child against parent the young are listening to him he attracts the young we are arabs we obey our fathers our children cannot be our teachers how can we accept that the man we met in the street yesterday can be some god s prophet today dead bones can live again he says because he who created man can also make man return from the dead he says the gods might leave us and give their benefits to another city tell him we will give him authority position and keys to the kaaba and money what money he wants tell him we will give him anything he wants muhammad spare yourself and me do not put a greater burden on an old man that he can bear in your childhood you were in my arms i cannot now see you hurt if you refuse them they will hurt you he said this to me were they to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left i would not renounce my message which is from god when i am dead you may do as you please but whilst i m alive you will obey your father why did you hurt our father if i were drunk every day and played dice every night you d call it high spirits you will be more my brother than you are now you are all my children i ve given you everything i could but it seems not to be enough muhammad gives me more he give all the world more get him out of here father it s not waleed or me it s our father you tortured him wait hudayfa wait how can they say it s an invention musab when it isn t new in mecca it s new yet god has said it all before to noah moses jesus to all the prophets but people changed it turned it forgot it now god said it to muhammad again and it is new again what is it it s jafar what have you brought with you the very word of god when the sun is overthrown when the stars fall when the mountains vanish when the camels big with young are abandoned when the wild beasts are herded together when the seas rise when the souls are sorted when the female infant who is buried alive asks for what crime she was killed when the books are opened when the sky is torn away then every soul will know what it has done were you\n",
      "CHUNK 2:  there jafar when god gave him these words dawn is coming up ammar you first then you jaafar ammar you kept your mother awake all night with worry i m sorry father where were you have you been with muhammad again what will happen now forgive him it was my fault i did it that god has helped us all our lives but it fell it could not even help itself what talk have you been listening to the real god is unseen he s not made of clay ammar we see the gods in the kaaba every day i m afraid for you you re listening to people who will hurt you i m listening to muhammad mother muhammad is generous yes he gives he shares he ll pass no man without a smile but he is spreading dangerous ideas dangerous ideas that no man should start that the rich should not afloat the poor the strong should not oppress the weak are these dangerous ideas girls should not be forced into marriage but be able to choose or refuse by only tonight he said stop the burial of new born girls i was fortunate always fortunate with your mother yes but you know that you and i nearly never met yasser and you were nearly never born i was to be buried like my two sisters but my father couldn t do it he couldn t do it the third time when the second girl was being when my father was putting sand over her she took hold of his finger the way a baby does he told my mother afterwards that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased and he dared take away his hand when i was born my father ran out of the house screaming that he couldn t do it again that he could never do it again sumayyah it is the custom but it s wrong the gods that let such things be are no gods i promised to go to muhammad s house mama we pray there yes he is a good man yes yes you go two men are following him read muhammad can neither write nor read but he can speak what did you say he can speak well so can you so now you speak up young man what does muhammad say umm they are god s words not his which god s what words a speaking god your muhammad speaks only to himself when god reveals his message to muhammad he remembers every word then he tells it to those who can write this is the quran muhammad has starved himself into dreams he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut his eyes are shut but his heart is open you kick him for his cleverness there is no purpose in that doesn t muhammad realize we live by giving housing to the gods we own the kaaba every year the tribes of arabia come here to mecca to pray and to buy from us now were we to replace 300 gods with just one whom we cannot even see who is supposed to be in taif and medina here in my house in jerusalem on the moon where would mecca be then the gods are both our worship and our revenue you cannot buy and sell god young man you are close to the whip ammar be sensible boy i have a question muhammad teaches you a slave is equal to his master this black bilal who i paid money for equal to me yes muhammad says before god all men are as equal as the teeth of a comb this is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars it gives them pretensions bilal teach this man the difference between the lord of mecca and a slave take that whip lash his face to teach his mouth a lesson whip him whip him cut him whip him do it bilal obey them they will kill you see what anarchy they bring they ve even infected our slaves if you re human enough to have gods remember they are the gods of your owner i bought your humanity bilal when i bought you you will be corrected one one god there is only one god who is stronger now your master or this one

let him speak where s the lie and where s the truth when it hasn t been spoken yet muhammad is a fraud stand up hit me back if you dare i affirm my nephew s religion and i say what he says whoever has the courage to fight fight with me muhammad when i hunt the desert at night i know god is not kept in a house who would have thought that hamza hamza above all with his wine drinking lion hunting would come to join muhammad the more we attack him more they seem to join him where does he find his words i don t know how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain and come down three days later blazing with poetry if it were just poetry he says it s god how do we fight someone whose strength we do not understand muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies so naturally he s found an audience then we must make that audience less eager to listen to him we will begin with the weaker ones your turn have mercy stretch her who is your god answer me say it say hubal is your god say it there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god oh my god ammar your father and mother are the first martyrs of islam you are\n",
      "CHUNK 3:  promised paradise how much are you men prepared to suffer the prophet has said we must leave mecca if you stay they will kill you one by one muhammad says that in abyssinia there is a christian king no man is wronged in his country we must leave now today uthman god be praised let us go we found their tracks and followed them but they just disappeared they were there in the desert under the vultures and you let them escape you escape they vanished if muhammad has stayed then only the weakest have gone weak or strong they ll blacken our name we re honest merchants we buy and sell in good faith we cannot afford scandal abyssinia amr you are a friend of annajashi the king yes can you use that friendship i think i can bring them back yes abyssinia rise up amr please nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one\n",
      "CHUNK 4:  god only wait when we take this pledge we expel ourselves from the rest of arabia so wait war is in this pledge we are to make enemies of brothers we are to make firewood of our gods that is the meaning of the pledge if we take it there can be no turning back for muhammad is indeed the messenger of god foretold to us by the jews in our city so if anyone has doubt in this pledge go now and if you have no doubts then you do as i do i pledge myself to the one and only god and to you muhammad the messenger of god he is of us and we are of him let him bring his followers our brothers to us to medina sync corrections by pocong ltti this was a journey that changed the world the hijra or flight to medina only 70 people split up into small groups walking 250 miles of desert yet so profound were the consequences so lasting were the effects of this walk that from it the muslims date their calendar in this moment islam found it s future muhammad himself stayed in mecca in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely muhammad has become a nation he has received a city entering into pledges and treaties and you salool who claim to be king of medina lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed you should worry about yourself abu sufian every time you trade a whiff of perfume out the city you must creep past that man in medina he is across your mercantile throat so to speak and what do you intend to do l intend to wait and how long will you wait till you and the rest of arabia remove him to save your way of life and while you wait i should accept his call of course does he think i will give him my birthright i will not medina is worth the conversion hypocrisy of course it s a healthy hypocrisy king salool wiping his face on the floor 5 times a day praying i don t believe you he may not have to we ll do know what we should have done before kill muhammad come come and see they say that practice leads to perfection 7 young men each from a different family my own son ikrima is with them they will stab him together if the responsibility for his death is shared where lies the guilt my idea i m not sure i m part of it muhammad s body contains too much his mind his words but it is an ingenious solution and a final one no ali his cousin laid there to die for him who are we fighting they cannot go far all the tracks are watched he must take to the desert bakkah will give 100 camels to the man who brings back muhammad or his head look for 3 of them muhammad abu bakr and uriqat his bedouin guide what is it they re not grazing camel maybe two days that from the city why are you here medina is to the north they make the tracks not i nomads travelling west i know my art they say that you can track a bird by smelling the air we go with them he may be in that cave over there muhammad if you come out we will take you to mecca alive muhammad come out they can t be in there this this web is unbroken and these pigeons they would not build we were wrong to follow them we should have gone north let s move then we still have time to head them off a few threads of a spider s web were all that was then between muhammad and murder but he was a man not to be killed the bedouin guide led him and his companion abu bakr in their escape through untracked spaces of the desert and the heat of the june days at medina his followers waited with their welcome ready but in great fear for his journey anything no nothing he himself says he is only a man no man can survive that heat there i see them look run and hide i may be obliged to free you as a gesture welcome to the city of medina the blessed your city messenger of god you will stay with me messenger of god i have the best house in medina you will give me the honor of keeping you stay with me please please please how can the prophet choose between so many welcomes where god guides his camel to stop there he will build his house all agreed we turn quaswa his camel loose and where quaswa sits the prophet stays clever man a choice made by a camel can offend no one here we will build the house of the prophet and our first meeting place a prayer house the first mosque of islam here god is great god is great what is the prophet of god doing carrying bricks give me that look you are doing too much please go and sit down we ll do it look he went for more work is a worship he says he s 53 years old how old are you there is something missing maybe a bell to call the people in the christians use a bell mmm yes what about a horn like the jews a drum there s too much blood in a drum why not the human voice as in umar ibn khattab s vision the prophet agrees he means you bilal me you have a good voice use it climb up there brothers today a man of medina will embrace a man of mecca each will share half and half reach out embrace your neighbor and brother i m tired of the politics of kissing slaves read this the prophet should concern himself with the after world how is my son praying like a horse does it burn your hands if it s not torn up it will burn down the house he s making laws like a king he has declared that loyalty to islam is more than loyalty to tribal family what all muslims are next of kin to one another don t be mislead by that they must change the nature of the tribes before that the danger is here equality a man s neighbour is as good as himself the lunatic means it jews and christians have equal rights with muslims the jews who attach themselves to a common wealth shall be protected women have rights of inheritance rights next he ll be giving the camel rights he has the lunatic has you can t overload them he s remaking a city my city damn him he s taken our sons from us our future from us his rights are wrongs no more this time it will not be just his riffraff we will take everything of value they have left in mecca their rugs their houses their silver and with it a large of caravan to damascus my friends listen to me i have news from mecca everything you have left behind is gone the thieves abu bakr s shops the prophet s house sold every cup or piece of cloth every rag or bone you ever owned is thrown on the market you are a people of nothing don t you even fight for what you own who talks of the fight what other way is there hamza when the prophet says fight we fight now he says peace exactly you are a peace loving people up to your necks and fore bearers go back to work we have to defend ourselves you are the messenger of god yet they mock abuse and plunder us and we do nothing in the package of war we are pathetic but they are led by greed we are led by god and you now i i know how you hate the sword but we have to fight they have stolen our property they are taking it to damascus right past our own door i say by god get back i m sorry i m carried away it s the pounding in my head please fight them but look at the sun it s not the time for prayer it is newly revealed by god to his

the mountains halt i thought we were beaten now victory is yours khalid we have no victory until we have finished muhammad he is up in those rocks we have finished our business we have avenged badr but we can end him and islam forever some of his fanatics are still with him they have the advantage of the mountains the risk is too high muhammad listen a day for a day the day of uhub for the day of badr our dead have answered to your dead our dead are in paradise your dead are in hell fire hamza hamza do you hear me hamza do you know that i am with you i hind do you remember anything hamza how you killed my father\n",
      "CHUNK 6:  and my brother now you too are dead my heart is light do you hear hamza light but i haven t finished with you death is too small wahshi cut him open cut him they lost a battle and what do they do they come home and dig the ground harder they re mad i agree with you they defy reason they are even happy they lost god sent their defeat they say to try them in their faith oh yes they are fighting with the sky they ll get what they want they want mecca they ll get mecca when we see the stars at noon don t underestimate them i ve learned that to my cost my friend mecca is more than their home it s where god spoke to man mecca is like a homesickness to the soul this year they re going as pilgrims what unarmed unarmed abu sofyan will slaughter them in the desert if you believe in god as they do it might be possible not to get slaughtered but i agree with you they probably will be be still do not let them provoke you that is what they want stand firm peace be to you the prophet says all who love god must renew their oaths to him under the tree they ve sent someone else it s suheil that means we might come to an agreement muhammad you have been given conditions of truce between yourself and mecca have you agreed to them yet what is this in the name of god the most gracious who is this new god they call gracious i do not know him strike him out and i cannot agree with this muhammad the messenger of god if i have thought you were the messenger of god i would not have fought you make it muhammad the son of abdullah agrees with suhayl the son of amr that is more factual well so i understand good that is better now it is agreed that you do not continue your pilgrimage you must turn around and go home mecca is home however you may continue your pilgrimage next year and for 3 days only in and out we also agree to the truce for 10 years during that time you will not attack any tribe or ambush any caravan or any individual associated with us and vice versa if you injure any one of us the truce ends and vice versa is that clear ten years ten years of peace we need that time we will use that time these letters from muhammad messenger of god to the rulers of the world call the world to islam to heraclius emperor of byzantium kisra emperor of persia muqawqis patriarch of alexandria god go with you god is great god is great god is great there are no different races in islam an arab is not superior to a foreigner nor a white man superior to a black all return equally to god unless you desire for your neighbour what you desire for yourself you don t have faith a man goes to bed with his belly full while his neighbor is hungry he isn t a muslim the ink of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr a man reading is handsome in the sight of god so learn to read and when you have learned teach the people of the book the jews with their bible the christians with their testament must be respected by you for their books likewise came from god you must not think of muhammad as more than a man he was collecting firewood one day let me do it i said why he said you are the prophet of god you can t go around scratching for firewood but he looked at me mumbling god does not like the man who considers himself above other men he said so i laid back and watched him suddenly he stopped he stood to his full height and came to me yes i am the prophet of god he said but even i do not know what will become of me amr have you come to take me again no i have come to ask you to take me i witness that there is only one god and that muhammad is his messenger may god forgive me the times i have fought against you islam does away with all that went before it i m sorry i came in here wearing here are my jewels what they are worth i give to the poor and may i offer you my yes but you were the bitterest sword against islam now by the will of god i will be the raised sword of god ah its all easy to god just as he makes dying living he can make losing winning two years ago we thought we were beaten when we had to sign that truce look at us now charging from victory to victory in the hearts of men what s that abu sofyan is coming abu sofyan why am i insulted like this i m abu sofyan i expect some courtesy we are not at war we have a truce i have come to speak to muhammad where is he he is in the mosque muhammad we did not break the truce i have come to reaffirm the truce i speak for mecca muhammad why do you turn from me don t go muhammad don t go bedouins broke the truce not us the night was dark i am here to testify the night was dark barra barra this is your city hudayfa you are my kin aim to see for me i must be heard i am mecca i am the leader of mecca why am i insulted like this because you keep no promise and respect no pledge i have heard what i never thought i d hear abu sofyan asking for pity to be outfought outfought outmaneuvered by a one time shepherd you saw that shepherd s religion grow from a speck speck was in my eye i could see nothing tell mecca their gods are dead it is useless to resist god travel fast or every man here will be close behind you it s you who have broken the truce for tonight will be ten thousand men from every tribe now we can fight them you are back we will close the streets and defend from the houses it s no use there are thousands of them every hour they are joined by more you coward hind go home you coward are you the leader of mecca look at yourself you are broke they swallowed you and spat you back did my father and brother die for my husband to run away you go home you we can not resist mecca is taken no no we are to camp here for the night i can see mecca even through the mountains so many fires i cannot count them it s very beautiful when we drove them out of mecca i did not know they carried mecca with them we can smell the bread they re baking yes it means they don t intend to plunder at least i hope that s what it means they don t want blood on their own walls and doorsteps i can bargain with that take me to him so you are giving us the city you offer me no bread i understand you may decide to kill me say what you have come to say i saw your fires the men around them and i know what power you put into your men we can no longer resist muhammad now if you ll agree you dare to come here and ask for conditions isn t it time yet for you to recognize who muhammad is muhammad there is still doubt in my heart if i were to cut off your head it would remove all your doubts khalid there s no compulsion in religion a man may take many years or only need minutes it s god who decides the time so respect his doubts you re a black slave you are the best school i am only what god has given me yes the gods that i worshipped they don t have any use it would have helped me i declare under no compulsion there is one god and you are the messenger of god now let me go get inside no doors may be broken down nothing\n",
      "CHUNK 7:  plundered nothing seized no one abused all behind closed doors are safe all in abu sofyan s house are safe all by the kaaba are safe at least he kept his word they haven t forced a door he s stolen hearts not walls it s a permanent victory i dread going out we must we must at the end were we so wrong the way we lived yes that was wrong we were trapped in our own faults our gods were less than us now there he is making his entrance to the kaaba in the name of god most gracious most merciful god gave this house to abraham to be a sacred place worship no other gods but him and cleanse his house so it was muhammad took no revenge and allowed none he declared mecca a holy place no one may shed blood or cut down a tree or kill a living thing in mecca soon all arabia was converted not only to the new worship but to the new laws manners attitudes contained in islam the prophet had lived to see his work done but now he began to feel the nearness of death one great act of his prophethood remained the setting of it s seal he called the people to him and he spoke for the last time his message of surrender to god and humanity to man oh mankind listen well i may not be with you much longer the weak among you feed them on what you eat dress them as you are dressed you will meet your god and he will call you to account for your actions let those who are present warn those who are absent you are all are descendant from adam and the best among you is he who most regards god think deeply about what i say let all your feuds be abolished you must know that every muslim is the brother of every other muslim and all muslims are brothers one of another between muslims there are no races and no tribes nor must you take anything from your brother except what is given freely do not oppress and do not be oppressed o my people i am but a man it may be that the angel of death will visit me soon and death will overtake me but i have left you a book revealed by god the quran which is light and guidance now he repeated to the people the final revelation of the quran the seal and termination not muhammad s words but god s word this day i have perfected your religion for you and completed my favour to you and i ve chosen for you islam as your religion on june the 8th 632 in his 63rd year muhammad died many of his followers could not believe the fact how can such a man die but abu bakr the prophet s friend stood up in the mosque if anyone worships muhammad let him know that muhammad is dead but he who worships god let him know that god is alive and can not die they buried muhammad beside his mosque in medina but the religion he preached found it s place in the heart of man it endured it multiplied still to mecca they come mankind the people of islam dressed in their pilgrim white all equal before god all united in this place of prayer each individual soul joined in a community of worship one god synced by jisin\n"

more music playing please rate this subtitle at www osdb link ahrcs \",\n          \" elizabeth previously on madam secretary we re renewing our vows the hour the minute we picked has significance it was the minute that we both knew that we were getting married 8 22 it was actually this joke that i told that really sealed the deal agh legalization of marijuana is the best way for the us to weaken the mexican cartels jay arizona governor barker implemented a new policy of separating children from parents who illegally cross the border i am against the federal government undermining a state s authority to regulate its own border come on senator there are a million reasons the federal government has to be in charge of the border you are trespassing on arizona state property if desperate asylum seekers aren t free from being detained unfairly in this state why should i sighs i guess you re accustomed to this sort of thing oh christ i meant social justice not jesus i just said christ and jesus my mother always said don t call him unless you need him so i think it s appropriate chuckles and yes it isn t my first arrested for protesting rodeo but it is the first time with a presidential cabinet member well we did what we had to do i think it was saint augustine who said in the absence of justice what is sovereignty but organized robbery my husband is a religious scholar i m well aware i consider him a foremost authority on saint francis whispers that is so gonna make his day both chuckle i understand speaking out but why did you allow yourself to get arrested i have to believe you have some connections what i saw in that detention center crossed a line i never thought our country would cross and i felt obligated to make the world pay attention i feel like the soul of our country is at stake i agree and souls are my business mccord elizabeth adams that s me turn to the side russell not exactly how we drew it up cable news is losing its mind and this may very well be the meme that breaks the internet governor barker s gone too far yeah what else is new i m sorry but this is what happens when a self promoting dc hating malignant narcissist gets his paws on a national issue and we should have anticipated it the arrest is drawing attention to the issue well fantastic the families are still separated the mexican border deal is dead president zaragoza is talking un resolutions against us and practically sending troops to the arizona border and our once popular future president secretary of state is behind bars i m not sure how much attention all that s worth professor russell history has taught us that we must confront injustice head on when we find it that s exactly what elizabeth is doing what by wandering miles beyond her mandate as secretary of state literally i would argue that what she is doing is precisely her mandate she swore to uphold the constitution arizona s separation policy represents an institutional erosion of civil and human rights it threatens our way of life i don t like what barker s doing any more than you do but there s more than one way to skin a cat mainly not in jail jail might be precisely the way to skin this cat because it is noisy look the bellwether of a crumbling democracy is always a violation of human rights look at nazi germany north korea ghana under kwame nkrumah iraq under saddam hussein it s a little premature to be lamenting the death of our democracy that is exactly what everyone said in those countries as human rights eroded fine but your wife is torching her chances of becoming president and saving our franchise from lunatics like barker those mug shots won t exactly look good on a campaign poster but you can bet her opponents will be printing them up on t shirts enough how do we put a stop to barker and reunite the families right now i m considering sending in the national guard sir uh i think that would be playing right into barker s hands i agree he s already elevated his stature by taking on elizabeth who the hell outside of arizona even heard of this guy before today henry that s right now that this has blown up mr president any attention from you will give him even more notoriety well what then i need a plan of attack sighs unfortunately i think it s best not to attack sir better to avoid a public showdown let this fire burn itself out meanwhile we work to get elizabeth released and deescalate the situation and focus on fighting the family separations in court fine sighs let s send an army of white house lawyers to handle it i d like to send mike b to represent elizabeth personally and i m gonna go down there too of course fresh printouts i divided them into domestic and international oh and the mug shot is officially a meme fantastic no shooting the messenger hey stevie hey russell wanted me to give you these talking points before the press conference yeah i got his email you didn t need to hand deliver it i actually kind of wanted an excuse to get in here i need your help it s not about anything happening today it s for the party the vow renewal this is me staring incredulously at you even before i know what the problem is the band canceled at the last minute and i can t find anyone to replace them you re worried about a band when your mother is in jail mike b is on that i m sure that she will be out in no time but this party is unstoppable i was thinking remembering really last year when you and blake and jay sang at our holiday party no why not because that was people singing around a piano for atmosphere you did notice the significant lack of dancing maybe if you guys picked up the pace okay even if i thought it was a good idea i don t have time to learn a bunch of songs why don t you hire a dj it just feels so impersonal stevie if your mother gets out of jail in time i m sure she ll be happy with spotify sorry i gotta go it s just that it s tomorrow night and they really want a band laser dawn was perfect they were one of the top cover bands in dc specializing in 70s covers including and especially peter frampton s baby i love your way which is my mom s favorite really not judging also bee gees how deep is your love huh so now i m just like on my knees to all these second rate bands and i m just getting nothing but no even knowing who your mom is well i didn t tell them that i thought i wasn t supposed to are you kidding me lead with that it s the only way to get anything done in this town aim higher girl okay thanks reporter how long will the secretary be in jail daisy secretary mccord was acting on behalf of the administration in spanish api opensubtitles org is deprecated please implement rest api from opensubtitles com are you okay i m fine yeah when i told you to focus on voter intensity this isn t what i had in mind can we just whistle past the reprimand please fine i have arranged for you a plea deal you plead guilty to misdemeanor trespass you ll be released immediately with a small fine oh god this isn t mute with gratitude is it i can t plead guilty you so can you plead guilty not only does it go against my integrity but it sets a bad precedent with respect to federal authority i was just doing my job i was escorting a foreign dignitary to check on his citizens okay well just so you and your integrity are aware you will be charged with felony trespass and you can kiss potus goodbye it s not lost on me mike i have a few dozen calls to make i ll let you think about that henry the faces of those kids the world has to see that they have to really get it and if i if i plead guilty the headlines will pull to the wrong thing but you have to consider what you ve already accomplished people are aware and you can do a lot more good outside of jail not to mention the good you can do in the world as president are you willing to risk that the viral mug shot s probably already blown that out of the water that s just an image that ll go away a felony conviction that s another matter whispers whose side are you on i support any decision you make you ve got to follow your conscience jfk said there s something immoral about abandoning your own judgment i think that was jfk the movie either way it s a good point it is calling case number 3247 the people of the state of arizona versus elizabeth mccord applause whooping gavel bangs order please i know this is exciting but pipe down folks good afternoon judge collins harley johnson on behalf of the people michael barnow for secretary mccord quietly god help me good afternoon secretary mccord good afternoon your honor how do you plead to the charge of one count misdemeanor criminal trespass it s not too late to talk about this don t need to not guilty in that case judge since defendant is not availing herself of our plea offer the people would like to proceed with one charge of felony criminal trespass understood how do you plead to that ma am bess for the love of god not guilty gasps mike groans sorry about him your honor i ve had worse now out of respect for your position as secretary of state i order you released from custody immediately on your own recognizance no bail provided that you promise to appear for all future courtroom proceedings no your honor bess come on excuse me ma am are you refusing my my order i mean no disrespect your honor but i m going to refuse to leave prison until all the detained children are reunited with their parents cheers applause okay then and your honor if you don t mind can i just say a couple of words before i go to jail go for it no one should rest until this inhumane practice is stopped all arizonans all americans should make their voices heard in fact i am certain that if every american could see what is happening inside the arizona state detention facility in sasabe they would do everything they could to end it because this is not who we are cheering thank you your honor i appreciate it yeah okay then trial date s set for one week from today russell suddenly she s gandhi and joan of arc all rolled into one only now she s martyring the whole damn administration excuse me jay whitman great the crack team leader what the hell happened to you well i was playing basketball oh forget it i don t care look the secretary is torching her storied career and now we the grown ups have to wall off the rest of the state department and the administration limit the blast radius by disavowing her actions she s standing up for the rights of children russell said the man who can barely stand sit down already i have no quibble with what s in her heart my problem is she s flying solo when we all need to be rowing together i m aware of the mixed metaphor the point is if she s going down in flames she is not gonna take the administration with her and if that hearing is any indication her trial next week is gonna be a three ring media circus which is bad for the business of government we need a nice choral trio polite ordered calming people get nervous when their government s devouring the headlines it s bad for the country arizona s child separation policy is worse it demands a noisy response maybe even a circus i didn t call you here for your opinion too bad groans for god s sake sit down say what you want to say the president should issue a statement of support for the secretary get behind her because some issues transcend politics as usual and demand a response whoa stop you think i don t care about what s going on with those kids if i had my way governor barker would be on his way to the hague but this is about process and what s best for our democracy i couldn t agree more okay look you might be in my shoes one day soon the point is the job isn t about doing what s right it s about doing what s best and that is right is cynicism a prerequisite for the job cynical pragmatism looking at every issue from every possible angle all at once and then figuring out what s best for the country okay so no one s leaving this room until we re all on the same page now where are we on challenging arizona s detention policy adele sorry but you need to see this what she was arrested again a guard from the arizona detention center just released it children coughing crying russell sighs deeply holy mother of god security buzzer child mama and he made a statement to the press if the secretary of state is willing to go to jail to shed light on this situation then i can t stay silent the world needs to know and now they do i stand with secretary mccord cheering okay now that changes things dalton public opinion is turning against you governor the latest snap poll taken in the last hour shows that 90 of americans are against family separations i don t govern by polls mr president fair enough but i think we can agree that your sheriff took things too far by arresting secretary mccord no sir law s the law none of us is above it clearly we don t see eye to eye on much but how about this i can offer you a seat at the table with a coalition of border governors to provide meaningful input on the border security deal with mexico we both know that s what this is really about and i m willing to compromise providing you reunite the families and release secretary mccord today let s get past this ugliness and work together you think my base wants compromise i get 10 000 folks at my rallies in tucson they are tired of namby pamby politicians willing to sell their souls based on the latest poll now you want a deal here it is rip up that feckless immigration bill you signed over the summer then we can get real about border security you know that s not going to happen governor then i guess we have nothing to talk about son of a bitch he wants to go to war fine i want all options on the table i can t worry about how much attention this brings to barker we have to end this even if it means getting in the mud i say we go after the man directly personally take him in investigate his taxes don t tempt me look if we re gonna do this quickly we need to draw blood there has to be some federal statute somewhere that barker s breaking by detaining all these people extrajudicially okay you really wanna ratchet things up and play hard ball we argue that this current policy barker is enforcing is beyond the scope of his mandate as chief executive of the state to what end well normally a sitting governor is shielded from personal liability as long as he s acting in his official capacity but we argue that this separation policy is such an egregious violation of human rights and so completely outside the scope of the state s domain that by definition barker is acting beyond his role as governor by ordering it and we charge him with kidnapping isn t that a bit of a stretch russell no it s a lot of a stretch i like it dalton get it in the works i m done with this bastard sure i ll send you all of the details in an email and hopefully we can confirm tomorrow morning that would be great all right bye bye we smelled dinner sighs you smelled more than that you smelled success hm it smells a lot like vegan chili guys i think i just got epic dreamscape don t worry i think they re close to finding a cure that s a band i hope that is not just a band it is the best wedding band in town this is gonna happen i m glad you ve made progress because jason and i are nowhere on our project yeah because you rejected my stand up comedy idea and now you re rejecting my mad libs idea because they both equally sucked what guys well the poem is now the only missing piece i m just more of a visual person i m more of a this is a dumb idea person move move move why don t we just try to do something with dad s stupid joke like the exact time of it phone buzzing what rhymes with 8 22 avian flu stevie oh my god i do not believe this i sent out a hail mary to laser dawn asking if they would consider reuniting for the secretary of state and they said yes we just went from having no band to being double booked ooh and apparently healing the wounds of laser dawn we are the world dude oh man daisy wasn t kidding about aiming higher hey i got the basket from win thanks for sending it over daisy he wants you to know he didn t injure you on purpose and he still wants a sit down with m sec i m sure he does did nolan really pitch charging barker with kidnapping potus is champing at the bit what s the latest there the narrative has shifted in her favor which is good but she s still locked up it s uncharted territory how s the leg it hurts like hell doc says it ll feel like this for a few days i know i m not getting any sleep tonight you should take something you have to be on your game tomorrow it s gonna be a big day yeah i know i ll think about it all right take care you too space jammies indica gummies thc pain cream jay marijuana edibles no way all those baby goats have pajamas bleating because they re cold oh why don t all farm animals have pajamas not the cows but the little ones anyway that s so doable phone chimes idea pajamas for small farm animals pitch to the department of agriculture phone rings jay whitman who s this man automated voice hello you have a collect call from an inmate of the arizona penitentiary beep elizabeth elizabeth mccord agh man to accept say yes to decline say no groaning to accept yes yes god yes ma am hey took you a minute there promise i ll pay you back no it s not that i just got confused you don t call me from jail every day i mean nobody does i mean not that that jail s bad how are you i m fine i they let me make phone calls whenever i want they let henry get some clothes to me and they ve even put a divider around my bed so i have privacy i m fine laughs jay oh sorry it s the image you sound a little weird i m sorry ma am these are weird times can t argue with that listen now that public opinion has swung so decisively against the family separation policy i think it s worth taking another crack at convincing morejon to help out with the legislative option unlike barker he has national ambitions and he can t afford to define his base so narrowly sure yeah we yeah it s worth a try we don t really have a choice i heard you were in the room when the ag suggested whispers going after barker for kidnapping and i think that if we don t do something soon potus will call in the national guard and that ll trigger the biggest federal state showdown since the civil war wow yeah so meet with morejon first thing in the morning and just in case the shift in public opinion isn t enough try to come up with i don t know some extra angle or an inducement that can win him over yeah okay uh yeah okay i ll get started on that like now sorry to ruin your night what do you mean what do you mean i mean that you re gonna have to work late and yeah no i mean that s that s my pleasure it s my job it s my job thank you that s i ll talk to you soon mm bye oh my god that was hard phone ringing kat hey jay what s up i m on a kind of painkiller congratulations i don t know if this idea where are you i am driving to aguila to visit my father oh that s probably not gonna be easy how long has it been it s been a couple of years i m uh just hoping for the best okay good luck thanks what s your idea what oh right m sec wants me to meet with morejon to take another swing at the legislative option i wanna know if this idea is good crazy or jay you re fired crazy chuckling okay all right let s hear it did you know studies have shown that thc outperforms most prescription sedatives and has no side effects did not know yeah get me ten minutes with your boss i promise she ll love you for it you might even end up with her job when she s promoted sorry to interrupt tight window pal oh hey buddy look here s my card call anytime let s get this done i m feeling it do you ever stop i m blessed love pot believe in what i preach thanks for doing this on short notice phone chimes anytime brother psyched to be recruited into the fight the senator is about to get out of a presidential advisory commission meeting love it i m the king of the ambush not that i ever ambushed you that s always a coincidence just yeah mm must be how a predator feels huh hm waiting ever so patiently in the tall grass to pounce i m a lion jay for my country just don t screw this up door opens wait for it the senior advisor mm hm okay now hey uh senator what a coincidence how s that i was about to call you but if you have a sec now i d love to run something by you sure first i wanna apologize for the other night okay emotions have been running high mine especially and i d just really like you to know that i respect that you re in a tough spot okay but now the whole country including most of arizona is rallying behind m sec and outraged by the policy so i d like to revisit the idea of you sponsoring a bill to force governor barker s hand my position has not changed if i may senator i think i have a way for you to help reunite the families and still be tough on immigration how s that i read every speech you ve given in ten years about illegal immigration and you always say the biggest underlying cause is the flow of drugs across the border that s right i have someone i d like you to meet this is win barrington the pot lobbyist laughs my mom reacted pretty much the same way when i told her what i was doing so i get it but senator there is no better way to defang the syndicates and gangs trafficking over our borders than to take away their biggest market well the kingpins are terrified of legalization not only would it cripple their business it would significantly curtail the flow of all illicit drugs over the border legalization of marijuana in certain states is already weakening the mexican drug cartels and marijuana grown legally in the us is cheaper and better than what the cartels are smuggling over the border which is effectively pricing the cartels out i don t make policies based on theories mr barrington where s the evidence oh you re right that s my bad some people get spun by data but here are the numbers ten years ago us customs and border patrol seized over four million pounds of marijuana at the border last year it was down to less than a million and with less cartel activity violent crime in border states that have legalized marijuana has gone down an average of 13 that s why marijuana legalization is directly linked to stronger border security 861 231 pounds of marijuana were seized at us ports of entry in versus 2 4 million pounds in and 4 3 million pounds in 2009 okay what does this have to do with me sponsoring a bill to pressure the governor you can sponsor two bills be the maverick who reaches across the aisle with a humane solution to family separation and a creative solution to get tough on immigration hold your base and expand it to a broader demo not only that the marijuana lobby is incredibly well funded one of my biggest initiatives as their chief lobbyist is to figure out where best to invest those funds you have a tough reelection coming up i d like to win okay so what do you say senator in spanish i speak english you don t have to treat me like a peasant okay well i don t i don t look at it that way i m proud of both my languages and cultures this is your culture now how you go around in the world sighs i was talking about the irish side your mother always so wild how could you turn out any other way what are you talking about she wanted me to go to cotillion i m not the progeny either of you had in mind how is she still in florida doing community theater probably happy she always thought she was a star too good for me and this place that you got from her moving all over washington california hey politics avocados okay writing a book airing out all your dirty laundry my laundry is pretty clean actually so telling the world who you wanna sleep with yeah yeah you like girls you like boys what is your daughter supposed to think desi s fine by the way thank you for asking no i m not doing this it s not why i m here clears throat look i am here come on you ve seen the news things aren t good here and i m just i m worried about you i have a green card i m legal never have i worked here illegally i know and there was a time when that would have been enough but uh you know what these days i m not so sure i would feel better if you had citizenship i brought the forms i filled them all out all you have to do is um sign and initial a couple of places and then send them in okay once you re in the system you re more protected okay tell me you ll do it tell me you ll do it in spanish in spanish sighs you know what i was born this way but i was also raised by a father who encouraged me to live my life on my own terms and that s exactly what i m doing security buzzer henry babe you in there oh my god yes oh i am so happy to see you hi hi hi hi hi that s quite a set up how are you holding up i m okay i m okay yeah i just got some news that uh morejon has agreed to sponsor the bill putting pressure on arizona to end that family separation policy so they re fast tracking it to the floor it looks like they ll have enough votes that s incredible how did you pull that off jay and a very passionate pot lobbyist who actually caused jay s basketball injury trying to get a sit down with me do you really want me to keep talking nope i just i m glad it worked out yeah well it s not entirely worked out though barker is threatening to fight the bill in court as an unconstitutional violation of the commandeering doctrine under the tenth amendment so we may lose support from senators afraid of triggering a constitutional crisis well don t go there yet barker might just be posturing yeah well he s got pretty good follow through too you know chuckles you realize we re not gonna get back in time for the vow renewal i know and i m so sorry henry i promise i m gonna make it up to you i m way ahead of you since we can t be in dc i brought dc to us whistles surprise elizabeth oh oh my hi our wedding party will travel make it quick though we got

awaits the honor of your attention show them in ambassador welcome to krill thank you for receiving us chancellor we do not get many visitors i can only assume you have come with good reason that is for you to decide i am told that moclus has been expelled from the planetary union it was inevitable the union imposes its values on other cultures while refusing to confront its own hypocrisy a governance of elitist fools on that we agree moclus and krill however have much to offer one another in these dangerous times we have confirmed reports that the kaylon are amassing thousands of ships the pattern of deployment suggests they are preparing to launch a full scale invasion teleya i am aware of the threat the worlds in closest proximity are vikarris and xelayah they will likely be the first targets and when those worlds are reduced to ashes who will be next you propose an alliance what exactly do you offer moclus was the primary manufacturer of armaments for the union what we provided them can be provided to any ally and what do you expect in return the protection of your superior fleet our two great militaries would ensure a formidable defense against the kaylon and any other union of militaries who may oppose us indeed who would lead this alliance naturally we would on what basis you are a female any other arrangement would be offensive scoffs how surprising that the union revoked your membership i must admit however that i admire your hubris to enter the dominion of a foreign power and suggest the wholesale submission of its entire military industrial complex there is a phrase i once heard uttered by a human helmsman aboard the union ship orville you have got balls it is the only acceptable arrangement i will consider your proposal for alliance under one condition a partnership of command i will need to consult with my government your weapons may be superior but as tacticians you leave much to be desired i have studied your battle strategies they are blunt and maladroit you lack the cunning and intellect of the female mind i will provide this all command decisions will be shared equally or there will be no alliance do i make myself clear yes chancellor i await your decision theme song playing intense music playing defensive line is moving into position nineteen kaylon ships just dropped out of quantum ten million kilometers and closing general quarters all hands battle stations bridge to engineering what s your status the device is drawing steady power from the quantum core it ll be fully armed in about two minutes sir power surging ed mercer isaac prepare to initiate on my command isaac yes sir dramatic music playing captain another 42 ships just dropped out of quantum jesus they re all around us charly how soon charly burke about 30 seconds captain mercer signal all ships to tighten formation aye sir burke device is fully armed sir isaac initiate power surging alarm buzzing isaac isaac to bridge were we successful yes isaac you could say that contemplative music playing light music playing you two have done a great service for the union for the first time in over a year we can all breathe a sigh of relief isaac the combination of my superior intellect and ensign burke s capacity for multi dimensional visualization was sufficient for the development of this technology we worked together yes but how did you accomplish it so quickly for great achievements two things are needed a plan and not quite enough time churchill isaac leonard bernstein can this device be used on a larger scale isaac the radius of destruction is limited only by the amount of power available the orville s quantum core was sufficient to destroy all kaylon vessels within a radius of ten million kilometers so in principle it could go even farther yes sir given a sufficient power source the range would be unlimited and none of our ships or people would be affected no sir isaac and i discovered their achilles heel by studying the kaylon the orville found on situla four every kaylon and every one of their ships is connected through a synchronization matrix that s how they coordinate all their actions even across light years of space and that s how you got inside the kaylon network isaac correct the device uses quantum energy to trigger a feedback loop in its interlink chain basically it turns the relays into a row of dominoes knock one down they all go down isaac after the initiation sequence is transmitted it cannot be countermanded and what about you why weren t your systems damaged i am no longer connected to the synchronization matrix this is better than we ever could ve hoped for our priority now should be to build a quantum core that can maximize the weapon s range and eradicate the kaylon threat completely yes sir we can get to work on your order uh well now wait a second with all due respect we re being very cavalier about this aren t we i mean you do realize what you re talking about is is genocide isaac was tasked with developing a weapon that could defeat the kaylon he exceeded our expectations we d be fools not to use it and is it really genocide if our only objective is to prevent them from killing every other living species including us admiral we ve seen first hand that the kaylon are capable of change and growth our experience with timmis yes i read your report about the emotive kaylon it proves they can evolve it proves nothing that kaylon didn t evolve on its own it was modified by a cyberneticist and correct me if i m wrong but it didn t work with isaac here isaac that is correct my capacity to experience emotion was only temporary captain mercer if you think that we can enlist and train an army of cyberneticists to teach empathy to ten billion kaylon i d love to hear your plan look all i m saying is that we have created a weapon of unparalleled destructive power and i just think that before we go cracking eggshells with a sledgehammer we need to consider the moral implications i agree this is an unprecedented situation with profound ethical questions but how we proceed won t be decided in this room it s a matter for the union council until they make a determination there s nothing more to say tranquil music playing you re kidding me right what is there to even talk about i mean it s just a big decision how is it a big decision they want us all dead we want to stay alive that s a pretty basic equation it s us or them yeah i know the kaylon got a raw deal back home but i gotta say i agree with charly plus the fact that we re sitting ducks since we kicked the moclans out john lamarr look charly don t get me wrong as an engineer i am blown away by what you and isaac were able to do here but i also understand why people are taking a minute i agree we re talking about exterminating an entire species i can t think of anything that runs more contrary to union values and let s be goddamn clear about the motive are we doing this to save ourselves or is this revenge my dad used to say revenge is for children and savages yeah well he never had his leg cut off oh come on man it s a joke it s not funny sorry look i know isaac s your best pal so maybe you re a little biased hey watch it ensign i gotta get back to duty if we d had this weapon a year ago and used it amanda might still be alive we built it we tested it it works let s wipe em off the face of the galaxy contemplative music playing that was the most heated session i ve ever witnessed but the union council has reached a compromise they ve decided we should use the weapon as a deterrent meaning what exactly according to napoleon the whole of war is to frighten your enemy into submission ideally without fighting he was a tyrant but he was accurate on that point we will travel to kaylon to reveal the nature of the device and our willingness to use it they saw what happened to their invasion force at xelayah if nothing else the kaylon are logical beings it should persuade them to accept an immediate and absolute cease fire and if they refuse our terms we re authorized to use the weapon again to make our point clear martial music playing captain we re approaching the kaylon system go to tactical alert five kaylon vessels on an intercept course bridge to engineering everything ready we re at full power mercer stand by to initiate on my command intense music playing hail them alert chimes channel open this is admiral thomas halsey of the planetary union we are here on a mission of peace i wish to speak with kaylon primary they are powering weapons we re armed with the weapon we deployed during our last confrontation stand down or we will be forced to use it again engineering initiate power surging ships exploding proceed to kaylon with pleasure sir engineering initiate sir we are being hailed let s hear it kaylon primary this is kaylon primary we will receive you transmitting landing coordinates got em stand down tactical alert take us down uneasy music playing epic music playing kaylon primary kaylon primary that is correct you look better than the last time we saw you kaylon primary a kaylon s neural matrix can be regenerated indefinitely an advantage biologicals do not have state your demands our demands are simple end your campaign to exterminate us stop your attacks against our ships and our worlds recall your vessels and cease all further weapons construction we will place monitoring stations inside your territory to verify your compliance kaylon primary do you intend to enslave us of course not we re not here to conquer you we just want to end the violence and establish a basis for peaceful coexistence kaylon primary how do we know this is not a deception we could ve killed every one of you without warning we didn t kaylon primary why because we re not the monsters you think we are we believe the quality of mercy is mightiest in the mightiest regardless deception or not you don t have a choice trust us or be destroyed it s a simple binary decision kaylon primary we have no defense against your weapon therefore we will surrender to your demands it may not seem like it now but one day you ll realize that you ve made the right decision kaylon primary we will find a weakness in your weapon trust me it s a bad idea for you to go looking isaac any attempt to disable the weapon will immediately activate it kaylon primary there is always a weakness isaac your existence is proof of that i ll inform the union council that you ve agreed to our terms we ll work out the details of the armistice in the coming weeks i imagine we ll be seeing each other again soon kaylon primary indeed peaceful guitar music playing through the corridors of sleep past shadows dark and deep my mind dances in leaps and confusion i don t know what is real i can t touch what i feel and i hide behind the shield of my illusion so i ll continue to continue to pretend my life will never end and flowers never bend with the rainfall no matter if you re born ooh ooh to play the king or pawn ooh ooh for the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow so my fantasy becomes reality and i must be what i must be and face tomorrow so i ll continue to continue to pretend my life will never end and flowers never bend with the rainfall whoo i told you this gal could sing right hey listen i just wanna congratulate this crew on the key role you all played in this i would say this may be the single greatest step toward the cause of galactic peace in our lifetimes and you should all feel insanely proud of yourselves even gordon laughter thank you thanks a lot so this is a rare bottle of very old rum from the 21st century my dad told me it was only to be opened for the most special of occasions and if he were still with us today i think he d give this one the thumbs up so here s to you dad and let s get hammered yeah cheers jazzy guitar music playing kel this place is so beautiful god i d wanna spend all my time here forget space yeah my dad left it in good condition ed and i used to come here during the holidays when we were married it s been a while i miss it yeah i bet i told you you are doing it wrong i am doing it exactly as i was shown that is hardly possible because we have not yet penetrated the shell do not shout at me i will access the interior meat bortus you need some help there here cracking there ya go buddy thank you now we look like fools insects chirruping topa why is that part of the sky glowing green isaac it is a phenomenon known as the aurora borealis when charged particles from the sun collide with the planet s atmosphere the air molecules are induced into a higher energy state i have never seen such beauty the earth s full of surprises huh hey isaac show her the big dipper isaac an asterism in the constellation ursa major whirring door creaks open mercer hey you all right yeah i m fine sir thanks you know you and gordon should do another song maybe later okay you know we should ve wiped out the kaylon when we had the chance you think so i think we re making a huge mistake yeah well i know you re not alone captain do you honestly think they can ever be trusted i think we need to give the armistice a chance then you must think i m a lousy person no i don t i think you re a hell of an officer who s made tremendous strides since you came on board i know it hasn t been easy it s not that i think they re all evil timmis proved they can change and so did isaac but the rest of them i mean it s not like we helped them toward some great moral awakening we forced their hand what if they find a weakness i mean that s it we ve blown our only chance to save ourselves well it s a fundamental tenet of union philosophy that we don t kill unless we have to we didn t have to i just hope those high minded morals don t kill us dramatic music playing indistinct chatter sub level 32 elevator whirring can i help you i have orders to transport the device to another site we haven t received any new orders that s strange you should have received them an hour ago check your security logs intense music playing we don t have much time gears clang team echo here we ve accessed the device on our way to you deep garbled voice acknowledged dramatic music playing hey good morning hi there didn t want to miss the sunrise claire wow that is really beautiful the sun rising on a new era isn t it sure seems that way you know ever since we lost the moclans i ve had this pit in my stomach about the kaylon wondering how much time we have left when are they coming for us and now it s all over so what are we gonna stress about today hangovers ugh no kidding it s mornings like this i m jealous of talla no liver yep yeah we were born on the wrong planet comm beeping beeping continues commander admiral hi is ed with you he s still sleeping what s going on wake him and gather your team the device has been taken ominous music playing martial music playing you are late was there a problem nothing i couldn t handle and the weapon it s in the shuttle secure it i see you ve found a new friend friends are scarce these days well that s what happens when your government sanctions kidnapping and torture true to his ethics even as he commits treason what a noble creature this is not treason quite the opposite i believe in the idealism of the union but my compatriots have made a grave mistake sooner or later the kaylon will figure out a defense against this weapon and we will lose our tactical advantage the union won t do what needs to be done i know you will if this weapon is everything you profess admiral i can promise you the swift extinction of the kaylon the device does not come with an instruction manual at the moment the only ones who know how to use it are isaac and ensign burke i wish i could help you there your scientists are just gonna have to do some reverse engineering a facility has already been prepared well then there s nothing more to be said and what does a union admiral do with himself after the illegal bestowment of such largesse go back to earth and turn myself in martial music playing he will inform the union of our alliance they will learn soon enough it will strike fear into the hearts of many it will but there is no need to rush the revelation dramatic music playing explosion i spoke to the guards on duty last night there was no forced entry beyond this point whoever did this had fleet level command codes halsey you can stop searching at 2300 hours an unscheduled shuttle left the dockyard on a heading for krill space under this authorization my god he didn t report in this morning and no one can find him there s your fleet level codes why would he do this i didn t want to believe it either but perry s view of the council s decision was no secret he s always been a healthy voice of dissent among the more progressive elements of the admiralty but who the hell would ve thought he d throw his whole life away to defend it if his intention is to try and use the device we need answers fast intense music playing we re approaching the shuttle s projected coordinates drop to sublight anything isaac i am detecting carbonate and metallo silicate particulates space dust or debris scans indicate traces of union alloys as well and residual weapons signatures what kind of weapons they appear to be krill and moclan isaac verify scan isaac confirmed data is accurate oh jesus an alliance molotov ribbentrop all over again it was only a matter of time this is bad this is really bad perry was delivering the device to the people he knew wouldn t hesitate to use it but they don t have isaac and charly how do they expect to figure it out they will seek dr kalba he is a weapons expert of great renown many consider him to be the most brilliant moclan scientist who ever lived if i had acquired the device i would take it to him where he is the director of a research outpost on draconis 427 moclus may have closed the facility since their expulsion from the union if not that is where we will find him set a course best possible speed dramatic music playing gordon malloy please tell me our jamming systems are going full blast bortus affirmative however i would not recommend we remain here long given the number of battleships in orbit i d say there s something important down there the facility is operational i am detecting a substantial power source what kind of power source it appears to be a quantum core one of the largest i have ever seen captain if the core s big enough it could extend the weapon s range by thousands of light years everything they d need to wipe out the kaylon we re gonna need some help intense music playing kaylon primary is this your concept of humor unfortunately no kaylon primary then your carelessness has jeopardized our continued existence you must recover the weapon immediately god you know there is so much irony in that but i ll stay focused if the krill and the moclans have joined forces it means the balance of power has shifted in open warfare the union fleet wouldn t stand a chance kaylon primary you are proposing an alliance we ve already spoken with union central they re prepared to send every available ship with you on our side we can devise a battle plan to break through their defenses infiltrate the outpost and recover the device but we need to act fast while we still have the element of surprise that is assuming you re with us kaylon primary given your evident incompetence we may be better served to retrieve the weapon on our own works for me isaac if the weapon has been armed you will require the presence of myself or ensign burke to disable it what ll it be kaylon primary once again you leave us with no alternative we agree to this temporary alliance i m pleased to hear it we ll be transmitting rendezvous coordinates don t be late dramatic music playing martial music playing welcome aboard the orville if you ll follow us we ll escort you to the conference room kaylon primary we are familiar with its location as you recall we occupied this vessel during our previous encounter i do and as you recall we kicked your asses come on kaylon primary how do you intend to retrieve the device the quantum core is located 500 meters inside the southeast perimeter unfortunately the chamber is deep underground and heavily fortified if we can penetrate the interior isaac and i can scan for the location of the device it shouldn t be too far from the core the question is how do we get in there is an emergency tunnel that connects to the surface i believe that is the best option in order to get the ground team down there unnoticed we ll need a big distraction which means engaging their ships in orbit a squadron of pterodons will provide cover for the shuttle once inside we ll locate and extract the weapon kaylon primary and if extraction is not possible then we ll have to destroy it lamarr and malloy will be heading up the pterodon squadron i ll be leading the ground team along with isaac ensign burke and commander keyali the combined union and kaylon fleets will engage the krill and the moclans as long as we need to any questions kaylon primary i will accompany the ground mission i had assumed that you would be leading the kaylon fleet kaylon primary kaylon secondary will command our forces we already have one kaylon we don t need another kaylon primary on the contrary isaac has proven he is not to be trusted we trust isaac we don t trust you kaylon primary you misplaced the weapon once before i intend to ensure it does not happen again you follow every one of kelly s orders to the letter or she s authorized to shoot you got it just stay on my good side and you ll be fine hon kaylon primary very well martial music playing captain ships approaching what ships union vessels heavily armed show me dramatic music playing alert the fleet and notify the chancellor assume

ll target us it s either that or we crash what about the egress packs all right let s go group leader to kaylon get your shiny asses down here we need reinforcements energy pulsing kaylon primary at our current altitude of 5 000 meters we will need to achieve terminal velocity before we initiate reverse thrust just hit the button before you hit the ground good luck heroic music playing sir the

suspenseful music playing comscanner beeping i ve got it the quantum core is about 900 meters to the northwest charly there are multiple access routes fastest one will get us there in about six minutes lead the way soldiers speaking in native language weapons firing there s gotta be another way in there s another set of tunnels 50 meters to the south it s the long way around but it ll get us there go take isaac we ll catch up how much longer once the arming sequence begins it will take the device approximately eight minutes to draw sufficient power from the quantum core and then then it will initiate our transmitter array will propagate the signal good work doors open chancellor the facility has been breached deploy all defensive units to the access points dr kalba when i return i expect every kaylon within 10 000 light years to be dead i will do my best chancellor bring the array online energy pulsing the outpost is powering its transmitter array mercer to malloy any chance you can do some damage to those transmitters we got a whole division of krill up our ass but we can sure as hell try malloy to lamarr permission to reconfigure weapons for short range ground strikes

primary you will terminate the countdown sequence immediately electronics chirping i i cannot why not the firing armature is interlocked with the quantum core it cannot be uncoupled you are too late isaac he is correct you need to shut down the core that would take hours there are multiple fail safe encryptions in place we ll see about that groans intense music playing screaming bones crack you re really starting to piss me off your passions are easily roused this is what cost you your marriage yes not gonna work you need emotional balance and you need a dermatologist power surging isaac the weapon will initiate in 5 3 minutes every time we decrypt a fail safe another one locks in we re not gonna make it kaylon primary what are you doing thinking four dimensionally special talent kaylon primary i do not understand what shut up and let me work kaylon primary why did you not terminate him isaac it was not essential you could learn something from isaac intense music playing a gift for avis took you long enough dramatic music playing report the weapon is gonna initialize in three minutes i can t disable it and i can t shut down the core i m trying to trigger an overload isaac that would effectively destroy the quantum core and the weapon do not be a fool they will kill us all if you get her out of here can you do it i think so only problem is when this thing blows it s gonna take out the entire outpost and a good chunk of the planet with it you should go what charly we re not leaving without you set up a timer delay it s not that simple we ll figure out another way there is no other way i m giving you an order i have my orders commander my orders are to disable this weapon by any means necessary unless you re countermanding those orders step away and let me do my job sir metallic clanging you have two minutes go rumbling get out if you can where s the nearest shuttle that way energy pulsing captain i am detecting a power surge inside the outpost it is the quantum

rumbling alert beeps sir a krill shuttle is hailing us put em on shuttle to orville permission to dock granted kelly what happened down there we couldn t disarm the weapon we had to destroy it where s charly we we couldn t bring her home are you okay yeah teleya s in sickbay after claire s done with her talla s gonna take her to the brig you should be in sickbay too i ll be fine so what happens now do you depart peacefully or is this battle not over isaac primary an inquiry has been put to you kaylon primary the biological terminated her existence why to save you kaylon primary please clarify there s nothing to clarify i just answered your question kaylon primary this reasoning is unsound please explain she sacrificed herself so that the kaylon could live kaylon primary why would she do this isaac because these biologicals are not as our builders were it is what i have attempted to communicate they are worthy of preservation they are my friends kaylon primary perhaps we have been incorrect in our assessment she hated you for what you did and she still gave her life for you you re goddamn right you re incorrect tranquil music playing bad pennies will keep turning up won t they you have no right to detain me if we hadn t stopped you you would ve committed genocide that s all the right i need i just wanted to let you know we re taking you back to earth you did not have to come here to tell me that i can t protect you this time and i have no desire to but there s someone you seem to have forgotten about anaya is in safe hands you ll be tried for war crimes after that i don t know what s gonna happen to you but she needs a home i can give her one release me and i will arrange it jesus you are contemptible and you are a sentimental fool i m sentimental because i care what happens to our daughter is that what you re saying you can t just leave her alone the fulfillment of a divine purpose eclipses all family bonds one day anaya will understand this and as long as i am a prisoner i promise you will never see her door opens shuts if you choose to accept joint ratification of an alliance we are prepared to offer kaylon a provisional seat on the union council where you will have a tempered voice in the enactment of policy eventually if you behave in good faith and if the council sees fit you may be offered full membership into the union should you so desire it it s an opportunity to help shape the future not just for your world but for thousands of others in return we will expect a full defensive commitment against the newly formed moclan krill alliance kaylon primary we have reviewed the organizational structure of your council and its history of deliberations what you call representative democracy is a most inefficient form of governance maybe but the one thing you can say for democracy is that all other forms of government are even worse over thousands of years and on countless planets it s the best system anyone s ever come up with to ensure the strong don t dominate the weak at least not for long kaylon speaking machine language kaylon primary we accept your terms tranquil music playing mercer we are gathered here in remembrance of a fallen shipmate one who left us far too soon ensign charly burke will receive the union medal of valor posthumously for her unwavering sense of duty and for the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of peace no medal can bring her back but we can acknowledge our debt to an outstanding union officer and an extraordinary human being who would like to speak first isaac i wish to speak dr finn assisted me with the construct of my statement however the substance is my own i presume it will be adequate ensign burke loved pancakes she consumed them with butter but no syrup and was indifferent to the addition of berries or other condiments as a child pancakes were her favorite breakfast i served with ensign burke for 257 days 17 minutes and 49 seconds and yet my understanding of her remained incomplete she had an impressive brain for a biological she perceived the universe in ways others could not ensign burke regarded me as an enemy yet despite her animosity she chose to save my life when no one else was able and in the final seconds of her own life ensign burke substantiated for all the galaxy her true nature one of integrity and selflessness and in her sacrifice she inspired the enemies of the union to become friends her existence was brief but much like the first domino in a succession her impact will be felt far into the future contemplative music playing theme song playing
